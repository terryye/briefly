And if you look at the pictures long enough, you might almost feel the sand between your toes!But the sand on the beach that was named the world's best is a little different — it's pink!Elafonissi Beach on the Greek island of Crete is famous for its unusual color. But it's loved for other reasons too.Safe for children and with warm, turquoise water, Tripadvisor says it's \"one of those places you have to see to believe.\"The sand gets its pink color from thousands of crushed shellfish shells, although it only looks pink on some parts of the beach.It isn't easy to get to — you'll have to take a boat or plane to Crete first, and drive to the far southwest of Greece's largest island.But it might just be worth the trip, especially if you go in the fall when it's a little less busy!Second on Tripadvisor's list is Banana Beach in Phuket, Thailand. The website says the beach is a good place to try some water sports or snorkel among the coral reefs.In third place is Eagle Beach on the Caribbean island of Aruba, which Tripadvisor says is one of the island's quieter beaches — but perhaps it won't be for much longer!Beaches in the US and Portugal are also among the top five.",

Sometimes called a \"polar bear plunge\" or a \"polar bear swim,\" the practice is named after polar bears  — perhaps because those animals have no problem swimming in cold Arctic seas.In many parts of the world, people take part in polar bear dips to celebrate New Year's Day, or to raise money for charity. Some people do it for the supposed mental and physical health benefits.But in the city of Most in the Czech Republic on March 1, 2025, 2,461 people jumped into a lake in order to break a world record!The previous record for a polar bear dip was for 1,799 swimmers who took part in a dip in Mielno, Poland, on the Baltic Sea on February 15, 2015, according to Guinness World Records.For the record to be recognized, the participants have to be wearing bathing suits, be at least waist-deep in water and stay there all together for at least one minute. The temperature of the water must also be lower than 10 degrees Celsius.During the dip the water was 3.5 degrees Celsius. But even though it was cold, the participants encouraged each other by holding hands, singing — and some even danced!\"Czechs are a nation of polar swimmers,\" said David Vencl, a freediver and the organizer of the event.Vencl himself set a world record four years ago in men's swimming under ice when he swam a record distance of 80.9 meters.",

The price of the train, they said, was between $115 and $260 per person. So they had an idea.They bought tickets from Newquay in the south of the UK to Malaga in Spain, costing $25 each. They then flew from Malaga to Manchester, in the north of England, for about $46.So they saved at least $44 by traveling thousands of kilometers!However, around Europe, there are some places where train travel is really good value.In Germany, there is something called a Deutschlandticket (pronounced doich-land-ticket) — or \"Germany ticket\" — that lets people make unlimited train journeys in a month for $63.People can travel across the country on that ticket, although it sometimes means they have to take slower trains.In Luxembourg, the situation is even better: public transport is free for both residents and tourists!For those who want to see more of Europe, visitors can buy \"Interrail\" passes online that let them make unlimited trips around a certain area or country for a number of days.For example, adults can travel on as many trains as they like for five days in a month for $346, which could be much cheaper than buying individual tickets.",

But with this new system, some discounted food that hasn't been sold by 9:30 p.m. will be available for customers to take for free.A spokesperson for the supermarket said the trial is part of its bigger plan to reduce waste and help the environment. Tesco has set a goal to cut its food waste in half this year.Until February last year, the company had been saying that it had already reduced food waste by 45% in the five years since 2017. However, it had to change this number to just 18% after discovering that a contractor had been turning some waste into gas for energy, which is still thought of as food waste.The free food system will be tested in a few of Tesco's smaller stores, although the supermarket chain has not yet said which stores, or when the trial will start.",

However, nobody really knew how it started to grow, so nori farmers would just put nets in the water and hope the seaweed would grow on it. Nori came to be called \"lucky grass,\" or ungusa.Kathleen Drew took the luck out of nori farming without ever going to Japan.Drew, who was from the UK, was a botanist who specialized in seaweed. On a trip to Wales in 1949, she went to a beach and collected a type of seaweed called laver, which is very similar to nori.Back in her laboratory, she put seashells in some of her laver samples, and a red type of seaweed started growing on the shells.Until then, scientists had believed this was a different type of seaweed. But Drew discovered that it was actually the same seaweed as laver, just in an early part of its life.When Japanese botanists read about Drew's discovery, it helped them find a way to start growing nori in tanks on land before moving it to the sea. This allowed farmers to grow nori consistently, and even allowed the seaweed to be grown in parts of Japan where it hadn't been possible before.Off the island of Kyushu in southwestern Japan, the Ariake Sea is the biggest nori-producing area of Japan. And in Uto city, Kumamoto prefecture, nori farmers who worked on the sea were so thankful for Drew's discovery that they built a monument for her, and every year in April they still hold a ceremony for her.",

It shows users which cafes and pubs are in the sun based on where the sun is in the sky, as well as the height of the buildings around them.Since the app changes in real time, when shade covers one place, users can quickly check to see if there's anywhere nearby that's still in the sun. This is also useful for anyone who wants to get out of the sun, because the app tells you which cafes are in the shade too!Users can change the time and date to see which cafes and pubs will probably be in the sun later or the next day too.Anyone can use the SunSeekr map through its website.

At present, just two in five new homes in England have solar panels.According to government plans, rooftop solar panels would have to cover 40% of the area covered by a new building. Around 80% of new homes would need to follow this rule, while 19% could have fewer solar panels because of the shape of the roof, or for other reasons such as the location of the building.Just 1% of new homes are likely to have no solar panels.The new rule will probably add between around $4,400 and $5,300 to the cost of building a new home. But since an average three-bedroom home with solar panels can save about $1,300 a year on energy bills, people could make back their money in around four years.The government also plans to give grants and loans to people who want to add solar panels to older homes. However, it is much cheaper to add solar panels when building a house than to add them to an older building.The new rules are part of the British government's plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.Solar panels also make energy cheaper. In February, a report by the Resolution Foundation think tank found that people living in the poorest homes have the most to gain from solar panels, because their energy bills would be cut by 24%.Lily-Rose Ellis of Greenpeace UK said the government's plans were \"common sense,\" saying, \"For too long we've wasted the free energy that falls on the roofs of houses every single day.\"",

And would you return to it if you could?Well, a survey has found that almost half of young British people would prefer to grow up in a world without the internet, and 27% say they would prefer if social media didn't exist.The survey of almost 1,300 British people aged 16 to 21 was done by The British Standards Institution. It said the results show how young people's lives are being increasingly lived online after the COVID-19 pandemic, and that there is a need to better protect their mental health and privacy.Three-quarters of the participants said they felt they spent more time online as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Two-thirds said they spent more than two hours using social media every day, while 26% said they spent four hours or more each day using it. And 68% said they felt worse about themselves after spending time online.The survey also found that parents may not know what their children are doing online, since 42% of participants said they had lied to their parents about it. Also, 27% have pretended to be a different person online, while 42% have pretended to be a different age.Most participants said they knew how to manage their privacy and safety online. However, 29% have shared their location on social media apps with someone they've never met.Young British people do want more protection though, as 79% said technology companies should be made to have strong privacy tools for apps used by young people, including age and identity checks.Over a quarter of participants agreed with banning phones from schools, and half said there should be a curfew on social media so apps can't be used after a certain time in the evening.",

It is held near Gloucester, about 145 kilometers west of London, and is at least 200 years old — although it could be even older.Thousands of people go to watch competitors from around the world risk serious injury in the hope of winning the competition. They watch from the woods around the hill or from behind fences at the bottom.Gravity and speed make it hard for runners to stay on their feet, often causing big falls. These falls can cause injuries like sprained ankles, broken bones or even head injuries.Ava Sender Logan, from London, won the women's race after somersaulting and rolling again and again as she held her head.\"I will probably feel it tomorrow,\" she said. \"It felt quite long coming down and then I hit my head.

A survey by the Liberal Democrats found that 54% of people wouldn't feel comfortable asking someone to turn down their music on public transport.Adding to the problem in London is having Wi-Fi on the subway — or the \"tube,\" as it's called in the city.Public affairs consultant James Ford worked with the local government when it decided to put Wi-Fi on the city's public transport. But writing for CityAM, Ford said that while it's nice to have a working phone on the train, it's also the reason why people can watch TikTok while leaving their headphones at home.Maybe if these people are going to watch videos on the subway, they could watch videos of people complaining about bare beating!As noted by The Independent, one  TikTok user asked, \"Why do people listen to music on speakers in public?

But when he started receiving calls about injured foxes in the city, he felt he had to help.Today, the project rescues about 1,400 foxes a year, including 400 cubs.Nicki Townsend is one of the ambulance drivers for The Fox Project, and she's seen a bit of everything since her first call just over two years ago, and has rescued many injured foxes around the city.The main causes of injury among foxes are cars, and getting stuck in things like soccer nets or small spaces. Many also have mange, a disease that can cause different types of problems.Sadly, the foxes don't always survive, but about half do. Cubs are put in packs of five until they are old enough and are then released in a non-urban environment while the adults are released in the neighborhoods where they were found.There are thought to be about 15,000 foxes in London.

An outbreak that began in early 2022 has become the largest in US history, affecting more than 100 million egg-laying hens.To cope with rising egg prices, some Americans have been going straight to the source — and renting hens.Rent The Chicken in New Hampshire is letting people rent egg-laying hens for six months at a time. For $595, you get two egg-laying hens and a guide on how to take care of them, as well as chicken feed and a coop to keep the birds in.The birds actually aren't very difficult to take care of, explains Brian Templeton, owner of Rent The Chicken. \"You just let them out and walk around and they go in at night on their own,\" he told CBS News.\"People really enjoy it,\" he added.Rent The Chicken says two hens should produce eight to 14 eggs per week.That comes to about $25 for every dozen eggs — so it's not really a savings.You can also get four hens for $735, which would reduce your cost to about $15 per dozen eggs.However, if you'd like to keep your chickens and coop at the end of your rental period, you can — for an extra $350 to $450.According to the University of Wisconsin-Madison, hens will usually live for six to eight years, and produce eggs for three to four of those years.So that might bring your price down over time.",

The plane left San Francisco four hours after landing, and arrived in Shanghai at 12:43 a.m. — about six hours later than it was supposed to.This delay affected not only the passengers arriving in Shanghai, but also people waiting to take the same plane from Shanghai back to Los Angeles.\"How could someone mess up this badly at work?\" a passenger wrote on Chinese social media platform RedNote, in a post that received over 10,000 likes.United Airlines is one of the world's largest airlines, flying over 140 million people around the world every year, according to its website.The airline said in a statement that the passengers were given meal vouchers and compensation for the problems caused.",

Almost half of the participants (47%) said they find it difficult to focus at work just before a vacation.Losing focus at work doesn't mean someone is lazy — they might just really need a break! And as many as 75% of American workers say they've had \"brain fog,\" meaning they're not able to think clearly, which could be a sign of burnout.The survey also asked about the warning signs for needing time off.Feeling \"burnt out\" was at the top of the list, with 62% of participants identifying it as a warning sign. Daydreaming about escaping was chosen by 45%, while getting annoyed with others was chosen by 44%.Also, 39% named feeling tired — even after getting enough sleep — as how they know it's time for a vacation. Thirty-five percent identified having low energy even on weekends as their sign.There's nothing like taking time off to help with burnout. But while we wait for our vacation, there are other things we can do to feel better and stay focused.The Mayo Clinic's advice is to find relaxing activities like yoga to do outside of work so you get a break from stress. It also suggests asking for help when you need it. This could be to your boss about your workload, or discussing stress with close friends and family.",

Cigarette companies even claimed smoking was good for you, with one famous advertisement claiming, \"More doctors smoke Camels than any other cigarette.\"But things started to change in 1951, when a British scientist found a link between smoking and lung cancer.Today, things look very different, and smoking in the US is at its lowest level in 80 years.In the 1950s, nearly half of US adults smoked. Now, according to a poll from Gallup, only 11% of American adults say they've smoked in the past week — half the number from 10 years ago.One reason is that more people now see smoking as bad for you, with 79% of Americans agreeing that cigarettes are very harmful.Another major reason is that fewer young adults are smoking.Young adults used to smoke the most out of any age group, but now they're the least likely to smoke. In the early 2000s, 35% of US adults under 30 smoked, but today, it's just 6%. Instead, it's the older generation that are the biggest smokers these days, with 18% of adults aged 50 to 64 saying they smoke.Although smoking may be declining, vaping is becoming more popular.Vaping, or using e-cigarettes, is less common than smoking, with just 7% of adults saying they vape. But vaping is more popular with young adults, and nearly 1 in 5 American adults under 30 vape.And if they keep vaping into middle age — and if young people today start vaping as they grow up — vaping might soon become more common than smoking.Health experts say even though vaping is less harmful than smoking, it's best to avoid both.",

The most common reason was to pay for unexpected expenses, though many also had to take out money for everyday necessities and housing payments.Only 18% of Americans said they used their savings for something they had actually been saving for.

    "content": "New Tourist Tax in Hawaii Aims to Help EnvironmentHawaii has passed new legislation that will increase hotel tax on its islands, with plans to use the money to help reduce the effects of climate change.The legislation will take effect on January 1, 2026, and will increase the tax on hotels and other accommodation that's rented out for fewer than 180 days from 10.25% to 11%.It's believed this extra tax could bring in around $100 million every year — money that will be used for different environmental projects.Hawaii Governor Josh Green said this new legislation is especially important after the wildfires on the island of Maui in 2023. The fires destroyed much of the town of Lahaina, and more than 100 people died.Speaking with The Associated Press, Green said the increase is small enough that tourists won't feel the difference. He added that, since many people go to Hawaii for its natural environment, he believes many won't mind paying a little extra to protect it.However, counties in Hawaii also charge a different accommodation tax of 3%, and there is a further 4.7% tax on most goods and services. This means visitors to Hawaii will pay a nearly 19% tax for their hotels — one of the highest rates in the country.Speaking with The Guardian, John Pele from the Maui Hotel and Lodging Association worried that the Hawaiian government may be taxing tourists out of wanting to visit at all.Almost 10 million people visited Hawaii in 2023, spending more than $20 billion on the islands.",

But it does need places for people to live.In fact, real estate company Realogic said that in January 2022, 192 US malls had plans to add housing to their sites.These changes have a number of advantages. The malls can use more of their space, and the new apartments mean people live right by the restaurants and stores, which they're now more likely to use.Some of the country's many malls have found it hard to make money with more competition from online stores.However, Jacob Knudsen, from the real estate company Macerich, told CNBC that he believes \"the mall is becoming cool again.\"Knudsen's company is adding housing to the FlatIron Crossing Mall in Colorado. As well as housing, some malls are building things like pickleball courts and medical centers. So these large spaces are no longer just places to go shopping.Of course, not everyone would like the idea of living in a mall, and some people are worried that apartments will increase traffic congestion in these areas.But CNN reports that mall apartments are popular among young people and single adults, who can have everything in one place, along with a ready-made community.",

This group includes 38 countries, mostly from Europe, North America, and other rich areas.In the study, 25% of American men aged 15 to 34 said they felt lonely for much of the previous day.This is much higher than the US national average of 18%. It's also higher than the rate for young American women, which is also 18%.The number of lonely young men in the US is similar to some other OECD countries. For example, in Turkey, 29% of young men say they feel lonely. In France, the number is 24%, and in Ireland, it's 22%.But in most OECD countries, young men feel about as lonely as the national average.The US is different — young American men are much more likely to feel lonely than the rest of the population. This pattern is not common in other OECD countries.According to the study, Americans who feel lonely daily are much less likely to say they smiled or laughed a lot, feel like they get enough sleep, or feel good about their opportunities to make friends.They're also half as likely to be \"thriving\" in life. In this study, \"thriving\" meant that a person felt good about their life, and felt hopeful about the future.So, loneliness doesn't just make people feel bad in the moment — it's connected to how they view their entire lives.",

The cost should have been 310 pesos, or about $16.But two extra zeros were added to the price, bringing the total to 31,000 pesos — around $1,600.The man told Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf that he checked the amount before entering his personal identification number, or PIN, in the payment machine. He said he wasn't sure if the machine made a mistake, or if someone had added two extra zeros.When he returned home, he asked his bank for his money back. But the bank said no. They said that because the man had entered his PIN, he had agreed to the payment.The man then took his case to Kifid, a Dutch group that helps with financial problems. But they agreed with the bank.The man also said the bank should have noticed the strange payment and stopped it, but that idea was also rejected.So, what should travelers do in this situation?Jessica Walker from Consumer NZ says you should contact your bank immediately when you notice a mistake.

The goal is to have 500 to 1,000 operating in smaller cities and around 2,000 in larger cities.Although Zoox will be putting its robotaxis together in the US, about half of the parts come from outside the country, the company said.Zoox CEO Aicha Evans said it was \"an exciting time\" for the company.While Zoox wants to challenge Waymo, it certainly isn't copying it.

The total land area of the islands is just 26 square kilometers.There are now five ATMs on the main island of Funafuti, where about half of the country's residents live.A ceremony with Prime Minister Feleti Teo and other government staff was held at the National Bank of Tuvalu in the village of Vaiaku. Bank CEO Siose Penitala Teo was pictured trying out the ATM for the first time.\"These were dreams for us,\" Teo said, speaking with The Guardian.It took nearly $2 million and about four years for those dreams to become a reality.According to The Guardian, until now, people would have to go to the bank on pay day to receive their money. This could take hours, and was not made easier by the fact that the bank closes at 2 p.m.There are now also 30 sales terminals on the island, meaning shops will be able to take electronic payments for the first time. Until now, almost everything on Tuvalu was paid for by cash.However, only prepaid cards can be used on the machines for now. The bank plans to introduce debit cards in the future.",

    "content": "A former bus driver from Kyoto, Japan, has lost all of his retirement pay after stealing 1,000 yen, or about $7.In February 2022, a video on the bus recorded the driver taking a 1,000 yen bill from a passenger and not putting it into the fare machine. Instead, he placed the cash in his pocket.After watching the video, the Kyoto Municipal Transportation Bureau fired the driver the next month. They also decided not to pay him any retirement money.The driver, now 58 years old, had worked for the city's bus system since 1993. He had planned to receive about 12 million yen, or around $84,000, as retirement pay.He took the case to court, believing the punishment was too strong for stealing such a small amount.But in July 2023, the local court rejected his request. It said the driver had stolen the money and broken the law. The court agreed with the city's choice to take away his retirement pay.The driver then asked the Osaka High Court to look at the case again.  In February 2024, the High Court said the punishment was too severe, since the driver had returned the 1,000 yen he had stolen. So it ruled in the driver's favor.But the case still wasn't over. In April this year, the Supreme Court — Japan's highest court — changed the ruling again, saying the city was right to not pay the driver his retirement money.This final ruling closed the case, and the driver will no longer receive any of the money he had expected after nearly 30 years of work.",

Japan will be getting them ready for this purpose before they're given to India.At first, India had hoped to use the E5 trains for passengers on the new 500-kilometer high-speed rail line.But delays and high costs have meant that India will instead use domestically made trains for passengers when part of the line opens in 2027. However, these trains are a little slower than the bullet trains used in Japan.Japan will be sending trains for passengers too, but later.The plan is for Japan to send its new E10 trains to be used from 2030 or a little after — although these won't be sent as gifts. And these trains will be able to travel at speeds of up to 400 kilometers per hour, according to the Times of India.The Japan Times said the two countries will be working together to meet the costs of the project, but both India and Japan will benefit from the arrangement.India will get some of the world's most advanced trains, while Japan can be proud that its iconic shinkansen will be used in other countries.",

    "content": "In many Japanese schools, after-school sports clubs are a big part of student life. Students play baseball, soccer, basketball and other sports to stay active, learn teamwork and spend time with friends.These club activities are an important part of Japanese school life. But by the 2060s, many of them might have to stop during the summer.A new study by Japan's National Institute for Environmental Studies and Waseda University says hotter temperatures could mean summer sports could become dangerous. The researchers studied data from 842 locations across Japan over 12 years.They looked at something called the \"wet-bulb globe temperature\" (WBGT), which includes heat, humidity, wind and sunlight. For example, higher levels of humidity can make the air feel hotter than it really is.Right now, the Japanese government has heat safety rules to protect students from heat-related illnesses. Schools should stop strenuous outdoor activities when the WBGT doesn't go under 28 degrees Celsius for at least two hours, and if it doesn't go below 31 degrees Celsius for at least two hours, all activities — indoors and outdoors — should stop.In the future, these dangerous heat levels will happen more often, and the researchers suggest around 75% of Japan could have several months when school sports need to stop.Some schools already try to have early morning practices or move activities indoors. And the biggest sporting event of the summer, the Koshien baseball tournament, now plays games in the morning or evening, takes long breaks, and gives players time to cool down. Organizers are also thinking about making the games shorter, from nine innings to seven.These changes help, but the researchers say Japan needs to do more, such as holding tournaments in cooler months or building more indoor spaces for sports.",

Eating out can also take time — which might be a problem if you have a busy day! And store-bought lunches are fast and easy, but they're not always fresh or good for you.In Japan, a new vending machine is trying to solve this problem by selling fresh salad, ready to grab and go.These new machines are called Salad Stands. They're made by Kompeito, a company that says it wants to help busy people eat better.Over 10 years ago, Kompeito started a different service called Office de Yasai, or \"Vegetables at the Office.\"  As part of that service, the company brought fresh fruit and vegetable snacks to special refrigerators installed in office kitchens and break rooms. This way, busy workers could eat something healthy without giving up convenience.Now, Kompeito is taking that idea out of the office.Salad Stand vending machines sell eight different varieties of salad, with options including grilled chicken, smoked salmon with cheese, and a seafood mix of crab and sardines.Salad Stands also sell juices, and granola made from leftover vegetable peels and leaves.But what makes this machine special isn't just the food — it's the technology inside!Salad Stands have built-in AI that checks how many people walk by, and the expiration dates on the food. If a salad is getting close to its expiration date — or if not many people are walking past — the machine automatically lowers the price.That means less food gets wasted, and you might get a good deal!",

So much so, that many people decide not to get married because of a Japanese law on surnames.According to Japanese law, couples have to choose the same surname when they get married. Japan is actually the only country to have this law.Asuniwa, an organization campaigning to end this law, surveyed 1,600 men and women aged between 20 and 59. Of these, 538 were legally married, 530 were single, and 532 were in a common-law marriage — meaning they live together like a married couple, without having filed for marriage at a government office.The survey found that almost 30% of people in a common-law marriage had chosen not to marry because one of them didn't want to change their name. And for people in their 20s, the percentage was even higher at 40%.Almost 50% of people in a common-law marriage said they would get legally married if they could have different surnames. And this was true for 60% of those in their 20s.Common-law couples don't have the same legal rights as legally married couples, and this can affect things like their taxes, inheritance and decisions about a partner's medical treatment.Based on the survey results and data from the government, Asuniwa says there are probably 1.2 million people in common-law marriages in Japan, and 587,000 of them would choose to marry if they could have different surnames.",

The scheme will last for four months and is likely to start in either June or July of this year.The city government plans to submit a budget to its assembly in June that includes 36.8 billion yen — around $258 million — to cover the costs of waiving the fees.Like many cities around the world, Tokyo's summers are getting hotter. At the same time, the cost of living across Japan is increasing. It is hoped that waiving base water fees will help people save the money they need to pay for air conditioning — so they can stay cool, comfortable and healthy this summer.Last summer, a record 263 people died of heatstroke in Tokyo, according to the Bureau of Public Health. A lot of the victims either didn't have air conditioning or didn't use it because of the cost.The Tokyo Fire Department said that in 60% of cases where people died of heatstroke indoors, the victims hadn't turned on their air conditioning, according to  The Japan Times.The Tokyo government plan doesn't mean zero water bills, however. In Japan, households pay a base fee for their water supply and then for the amount of water they actually use. The base fee depends on the size of a building's water pipes — the larger the pipe, the bigger the fee.On average, base water fees in Tokyo are between 860 yen and 1,460 yen — around $6 to $10 per month. By waiving these fees, it is thought that the scheme will save households around 5,000 yen, or around $35.",

Writing out addresses at hotels and hospitals was also troublesome for 76% of survey participants, and 85% found it troublesome to change their address when they move.To make life easier for its customers, Japan Post has introduced a new \"digital address\" service. It's hoped this will also reduce the number of mistakes people make when entering their addresses for online services.The digital address is a seven-digit code of letters and numbers that is linked to a physical address.Until now, some online services let users enter a post code that brings up the user's town or district, but users still had to fill out the rest of their address. However, entering the new digital address brings up the full physical address, down to the house or apartment number.The same digital address can be used even if a user moves to a new location. All they have to do is change the physical address they have registered and they can keep using the same seven-digit code.To get a digital address, people first have to sign up for a \"Yu ID\" on the Japan Post website. This is a free customer ID that can be used for Japan Post services.The new service was introduced on May 26 and is currently only available for sending parcels with Japan Post's \"Yu Pack\" service.

They are believed to have been used to hunt rats to protect shipments on their way from Southeast Asia to Japan.Soshin Yamamoto, a veterinarian, told The Associated Press the large number of bobtails in Nagasaki is likely the result of a genetic mutation that kept reproducing in a closed environment. But their tails are nothing to worry about.\"Having bobtails is no problem for most cats living a normal life, as long as they live near humans and aren't jumping and running around like wild cats in a forest,\" he said.Nagasaki residents hope the cats bring in tourists and help business.Natsuno Kani, a 50-year-old tourist from Tokyo who visited the bobtail shrine not long ago, said she knew Nagasaki was famous for these cats.But tourists from other parts of the world are often surprised by the cats' tails, as they're not too popular outside Nagasaki.\"Today is the first time in Nagasaki that I have ever heard of this,\" Cindy Bi, an American visitor, told The Associated Press.",

One of the reasons given for the increase in international visitors has been the weak yen, which is something that Japanese residents don't benefit from.In fact, some have said that it's gotten more expensive to travel inside Japan because hotels and other businesses have increased prices to make the most of the influx of foreign tourists.And they said that prices of goods in stores have increased, too, meaning people have less money to spend on travel.Other residents have said that with so many international visitors, many popular places have become too busy.But the government wants to encourage locals to travel in numbers again.In a town in Kagawa prefecture, tourists can spend part of their holiday working in a local bar or restaurant to make their trip less expensive.In other areas, visitors have been encouraged to work on local farms to experience life in a different part of the country.

Before, the setting couldn't be changed for each item, but now the machines can change the grind for coffee strengths and preferences.People who take milk with their coffee can also choose several different ratios of milk to coffee to suit their preferences.\"What we usually do in our cafes can now be achieved in convenience stores,\" Kasuya said, calling the machines \"groundbreaking.\"FamilyMart launched the new machines at the Expo 2025 Osaka, Kansai, and in a few of its stores in Tokyo. It plans to have the machines in all of its stores across the country by May 2026 — for a total of between 27,000 and 29,000 new machines, according to The Mainichi.",

    "content": "In many countries, it's not common to relax and have a beer with your boss and coworkers after work.But in Japan, after-work drinking parties have been a common part of the culture for years, with employees often expected to attend.Many people believe these parties help coworkers get to know each other better and speak more openly outside the office. The word for this is nominication — a mix of nomi (drink) and communication.Today, however, this culture is starting to change.For example, in 2024, only 60% of Japanese companies held end-of-year or New Year's parties — almost 20 percentage points fewer than in 2019.These parties mostly stopped during the COVID-19 pandemic, but even after pandemic restrictions ended, many workers didn't want to start them again.Some say workplace drinking parties feel like extra work, while others prefer to spend their free time on their own. Many are also joining fewer work parties because they worry about their health, want to save money, or want to avoid bad behavior related to drinking.At the same time, people in Japan are drinking less than before. In the past 30 years, alcohol use has decreased by 25%, with young Japanese people drinking less than older generations.Even so, many younger workers say they still enjoy after-work drinking parties. And a 2024 survey found that 69% of workers in their twenties wanted to go to a year-end party, compared to just 40% of those in their fifties.As the way people work and think changes, nominication is also changing.With more nonalcoholic drinks and relaxed places to meet, these parties may feel less like something you have to do, and more like something you can choose to enjoy.",

It's inspired by \"the traditional satoyama farming system\" of early Japan, according to The World's 50 Best Restaurants. The menu can change every day based on the ingredients that are available, but the price stays the same — 68,000 yen for lunch or dinner, which is about $470.In 36th place is another French-inspired Tokyo restaurant, Florilège, where chef Hiroyasu Kawate works in front of diners in an open kitchen.La Cime in Osaka is 44th.

This will take one hour and costs 2,300 yen, or around $16.The puzzle tour costs 3,300 yen, or about $23, and will take around three hours to complete.

However, during the match some still had to be carried off the field by staff.Cheng Hao, the CEO of Booster Robotics, the company that provided the robot players, said that sports events are a good place to test humanoid robots.He hopes to see robots playing with humans in the future — if it can be done safely.Four university teams developed algorithms to help the robots play soccer.In the final match, Tsinghua University's THU Robotics team beat the China Agricultural University's Mountain Sea team five goals to three.Earlier this year, humanoid robots took part in a half marathon alongside human runners in Beijing.

As early as the fifth century BC, all free men in Athens were involved in the work of the government.So it's probably not a surprise that it's also the birthplace of the word \"democracy.\" The word comes from two Ancient Greek words: demos, meaning \"people,\" and kratos, meaning \"rule.\"There are a lot of words we use in English that are of Greek origin. And while Greek words are nothing to be scared of, they do help us describe our fears!That's because the word \"phobia\" comes from the Greek word phobos, which means \"fear.\" If you're afraid of spiders, you have \"arachnophobia\" — arachne is the Greek word for \"spider.\"Many other fears follow the same pattern. So if you're afraid of dinosaurs, you have \"deinophobia.\"Deinos means \"terrible.\"  And the word \"dinosaur\" also comes from Greek, because savra means \"lizard.\" So \"dinosaur\" translates as \"terrible lizard.\"You won't find any dinosaurs in the zoo, but there's another Greek word: \"zoo.\" It comes from the word for animal — zoon.And if you visit Athens zoo, you'll be close to the town of Marathon.This is the place that gives its name to the running event, although we now also use the word \"marathon\" to describe things that go on for a long time. For example, you and your friends might have a \"movie marathon\" and watch all the Harry Potter movies one after the other!When we're talking about the running event, a marathon is 42.2 kilometers long.

It comes from Tagalog, a language spoken in the Philippines. Gigil is the strong feeling you get when something is so cute, you want to squeeze or pinch it!Another Filipino word, videoke, is a mix of \"video\" and \"karaoke,\" and is often done with a screen and scoring. The OED also added salakot, a traditional hat worn by Filipino farmers, and sando, a kind of vest.From Malaysia and Singapore, there's alamak, a word for when something surprising or upsetting happens. Food words were also added, including tapau (to take out food) and ketupat (rice cakes wrapped in leaves).South Africa brought in some colorful terms. Yoh is a word from South Africa used to show surprise or shock — and it's been around since 1855.Other words from South Africa include gatvol, a slang word that means \"annoyed,\" and sharp-sharp — a friendly way to say hello or goodbye.From Ireland, the OED added blaa, a soft bread roll, and ludraman, a word for someone who is lazy or stupid.These words may not have started in English, but now they help English speakers describe the world in new and exciting ways!",

In fact, it's actually better to use short, everyday phrases that native speakers use all the time.That's what researchers at Waseda University in Japan found in a recent study. They found that using short, common expressions can make you sound more fluent when you speak.In the study, 102 Japanese speakers gave speeches in English. Then, 10 language experts listened and judged how fluent each speaker sounded.They found that speakers who correctly used simple, everyday, two-word phrases were seen as more fluent by the experts.However, speaking without too many pauses was still the most important part of sounding fluent.But using natural phrases made a difference too. People who used simple, common expressions were seen as more fluent than those who tried to use difficult, uncommon expressions.Study co-author Shungo Suzuki said both language learners and their teachers often focus on \"rare words or difficult phrases\" to try to sound more proficient when speaking. However, he said, the study shows that this may not help you sound any more fluent.This is good to know for people studying for tests like TOEFL or IELTS, where speaking naturally and clearly is just as important as grammar and vocabulary.So don't try to sound like a dictionary — focus on two-word phrases and speak like you would with a friend instead.

Boys are also less likely to be read to than girls.The survey also found generational differences, with Generation Z parents — those under the age of 29 — more likely to describe reading as a subject to learn, rather than a fun thing to do. According to HarperCollins, this could be because these parents grew up with technology as a form of entertainment, so they may be less likely to see reading as a fun activity.Alison David from HarperCollins told The Guardian that \"it's very concerning that many children are growing up without a happy reading culture at home.\"She added that this could make children more likely to think about reading in the same way they think about things like schoolwork, and not as something enjoyable.However, 44% of parents said reading to their children helps them feel closer to them, and a third of parents said they wished they had more time to read to their kids.",

For example, the body part between your arm and your hand is pronounced \"rist,\" but it's written \"wrist\" with a silent \"w.\"Then there's a baby sheep, which is written \"lamb\" but pronounced without that \"b.\"These letters were pronounced in the past, but while the pronunciation has changed, the spelling hasn't!VowelsThe same pair of vowels isn't always pronounced the same way when used in different words.For example, \"break\" is pronounced \"br-AY-k,\" like \"cake.\"  But \"speak\" is pronounced \"sp-EE-k.\"  There are lots of these examples!HomophonesThese are words that sound the same but are often written differently, which can be very confusing!\"Write\" and \"right\" are pronounced the same, and so are \"flour\" and \"flower\" — so be careful when you're cooking!And there are different spelling and pronunciation rules between British English and American English too!The problem is that there's no quick way to remember all these spellings. Experts just suggest writing down lists of difficult words and doing a lot of reading, writing and speaking!",

Some said they had asked a digital assistant to set a timer for them.Almost 90% of the kids said they had no rules at school or at home regarding their use of AI.Those who did have rules said these included things like not using AI to do homework for them, only using it to get ideas, or having a time limit for how long they could use it.Nearly three-quarters of children said they were interested in AI.When asked what type of AI they would like to have, some said they'd like to have AI that didn't just answer questions, but that they could talk to like a friend, and that would play with them and listen to their problems.",

Eiken's top level is grade 1, while the lowest is grade 5.At Eiken grade 3, learners are expected to be able to understand and use language about everyday topics, including things they like, and information about themselves and their families.By the time they leave high school, they are expected to have Eiken grade 2 proficiency. This level is split into pre-2, pre-2 plus, and grade 2.The government survey found that 51.6% of third-year high school students got to at least pre-2. That's an increase of 1 percentage point from the previous year.However, the Japanese government wants both the junior high and high school numbers to get to 60% by 2027.And while Japanese students may be getting better at Eiken, they may still be behind learners in other countries.In 2024, language teaching company EF Education First ranked Japan's English proficiency 92nd out of 116 countries.That was the lowest Japan had ever placed in the rankings.

This is according to a study led by researchers at the University of Queensland in Australia.The study looked at online text from 20 countries where English is either the first language or a common second language. The texts included blogs, news stories and even company websites.The researchers identified around 600 swear words, including different or wrong spellings of the same words, and then looked at how often those swear words were used.They found that Americans use about 36 swear words per 100,000 words, more than anyone else on the list.The second most frequent users of vulgar language were in the UK, with Brits using 25 swear words per 100,000 words online. And in third place was Australia, with 22 bad words per 100,000.The most polite English speakers were in Bangladesh, using only seven swear words per 100,000.The research team noted that Australians might be surprised to find they're not at the top of the list, since many in the country see using copious profanity as part of their culture.Martin Schweinberger from the University of Queensland said Australians may just be more conservative when they write online compared to when they speak in person.",

At some onsen, tourists can not only spend time in the water, but also get a massage and enjoy some food.But authorities believe that visitor numbers have contributed to falling water levels at hot springs.Some have said that owners of the springs have been extracting too much water to make sure there is enough for their visitors.Owners of onsen have been encouraged to limit the amount of water that is extracted.According to some reports, local governments are thinking about offering financial support to hot springs, which are important for local economies.The hot spring town of Ginzan Onsen in Yamagata prefecture gets 330,000 visitors a year, with people coming from inside Japan and around the world.However, earlier this year, Ginzan Onsen began limiting the number of visitors arriving for day trips.

Between July and September, all hikers will have to pay the 4,000 yen fee.Officials are worried about the large numbers of people climbing the 3,776-meter volcano, which is very popular with visitors.The idea of introducing fees for all climbers is to improve safety and decrease overcrowding.Yamanashi prefecture also introduced a daily limit of 4,000 climbers on the Yoshida Trail in 2024.This limit and last year's fee may have done a little to help: while more than 204,000 people climbed Mount Fuji in 2024, that's down from 221,000 the previous year, even as tourism to Japan increased.However, Natsuko Sodeyama, who works for Shizuoka prefecture, told AFP that although numbers have decreased a little, more than 200,000 climbers is \"still huge.\"This summer, climbers on the Shizuoka trails will also not be able to begin hiking after 2 p.m. if they don't have a reservation for a mountain hut.Last year, Yamanashi stopped people from climbing after 4 p.m. without a reservation. That means people can't hike during the night to watch the sunrise, unless they are staying in a hut on the mountain.Casey Baseel from SoraNews24 said that the new fees are unlikely to stop international tourists from climbing the mountain, but Japanese visitors may find them a little expensive.",

A few weeks later Brazel returned to collect some pieces of it, which he took to Roswell's sheriff, George Wilcox.Neither man knew what the wreckage was, and so Wilcox reported it to the army. After seeing the wreckage for themselves, the army announced that it was a \"flying disc.\"  Then, the next day, they quickly changed their story, saying that the wreckage was of a weather balloon.But it was too late: the world had already started to believe that the \"flying disc\" was an alien spaceship. And some people still believe it to this day.So did aliens really land in Roswell? That depends on who you ask. But according to Roger Launius, from the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum, the army may have first encouraged the idea of a \"flying disc\" because, at the time, doing so was easier than admitting what they now say is the truth — that the wreckage came from a secret army balloon used to spy on Russia.Whatever happened out there in the desert, Roswell's economy is happy that it did.

Unfortunately, some Scottish food doesn't look nearly as good as it tastes, so some people will never even try it.Don't miss out on these three Scottish dishes that taste better than they sound!HaggisHaggis might be the strangest thing to come out of Scotland since the bagpipes. But what exactly is it?Traditionally, haggis is made by mincing the liver, heart and lungs of an animal — usually a sheep — and mixing them with fat, oatmeal and spices. This is then put inside a sheep's stomach and boiled in water.The final product is similar to sausage, and is best served with a glass of Scotch whisky.Black PuddingAlso known as blood pudding, this Scottish favorite is made from pig's blood mixed with oatmeal and animal fat, which is then put into a sausage casing and cooked.If the thought of eating blood is too gross for you, you could try white pudding instead. This is similar to black pudding, but does not have any blood in it, and is instead made from fat and oatmeal.Tikka MasalaWhile nobody is quite certain, many people believe that this curry dish was invented in a South Asian restaurant in Glasgow, Scotland.Traditionally made with chicken and spices in a tomato-cream sauce, tikka masala is served with rice and best enjoyed with a Scottish ale. It's so popular that many people say it's the national dish of the UK!",

Inside, it's a charming place of narrow streets, shops and cafes. But it can get very busy during the summer.Tourists like to visit the medieval castle — Chȃteau Comtal — inside the old city, and walk the ramparts to get a great view of the countryside below.Those who stop for lunch are often recommended to try the cassoulet, a French stew made with meat and beans.However, there's more to Carcassonne than just La Cité, and some tourists miss it.Walk from the walled city across the beautiful Pont-Vieux, which is one of France's oldest bridges, to get to the newer part of Carcassonne: known as ville basse — low town — or Bastide Saint-Louis.It's newer, but it's not new at all! There's still lots of history to explore, as well as lively squares, churches and an art museum.Keep going a little further, and you'll find the Canal du Midi, a 17th century canal recognized by UNESCO. The city's tourist office calls it \"a work of art.\"In fact, all of Carcassonne could be described that way — which is probably why that man in Nadaud's poem wanted to visit!",

It is traditionally made with roasted red peppers — which are minced and then cooked the following day — sunflower oil, salt and a spoonful of vinegar.A common sight in many Serbian homes, ajvar is typically served as a side dish, though it's also a great breakfast food. It is usually made in mid-autumn and stored in glass jars for the winter months.CevapiMeat is a major part of Serbian cuisine, which is why you'll find Cevapi on the menu of almost every restaurant in the country. Cevapi are grilled, finger-shaped pieces of minced meat that are popular throughout the Balkans.Serbian cevapi are made from either beef, lamb, pork, or a combination of these meats. They are commonly served in flatbread, usually with chopped onions and kajmak, another popular condiment.SarmaSarma is a winter dish made by rolling ground beef and rice into pickled cabbage leaves, or sometimes vine leaves.

It's believed that more than 25,000 were built in the country, many of which can still be seen today.Lichtenstein CastleThe first Lichtenstein Fortress was built in the early 12th century, but it was destroyed in 1377. It was rebuilt as a powerful castle in 1390, but became less and less important as it got older.But then, in 1826, the castle was an important part in Wilhelm Hauff's historical novel, Lichtenstein. The book was so popular that it inspired Count Wilhelm of Württemberg to rebuild the castle between 1840 and 1842. This is the same castle we can see today, standing with its tall white tower on top of an 800-meter cliff.Cochem CastleAlso known as the Reichsburg Cochem, Cochem Castle is said to be the largest castle on the Moselle River.The original Cochem Castle is thought to have been built around 1,000 years ago, but it was destroyed in 1689 by French King Louis XIV. The castle's ruins were bought in 1868 by businessman Louis Ravené, who began to rebuild it in a different style to the original — although some parts of the old castle were kept, such as its eight-sided \"Witches Tower.\"Burg EltzUnlike the other castles on this list, Burg Eltz was never destroyed during its 850-year history — and even still belongs to its original family.

New Zealand is one of just a few countries where sheep outnumber humans. New Zealanders are used to others joking about this fact.However, humans are catching up, according to new government data released this May. With a population of 23.6 million sheep and 5.3 million people, there are about 4.5 sheep for each New Zealander.That's down from 22 sheep per person in 1982, when farming sheep for meat and wool was New Zealand's biggest earner.By land area, New Zealand is about the size of the UK, but it has a human population that is 13 times smaller. That means there's lots of room for sheep.Now, years of falling wool prices caused by the increased use of synthetic fibers across the world have led farmers to change what they do with their land. That means that sheep numbers have fallen.In 2022, there were fewer than five sheep per person, which was the lowest it had ever been. Since then, the country has lost more than 1 million sheep.Toby Williams, from the lobby group Federated Farmers, said sheep farmers have begun using their land for things that will earn them more money, including dairy farming and forestry.He said that New Zealand is in danger of losing its wool industry completely.The government has made plans to slow the industry's decline and has encouraged the use of wool in things like carpets and insulation. But farmers think this may not be enough.Other sheep-farming countries are seeing similar changes.

A 2024 survey of 27,000 people by Booking.com found that 62% were thinking about visiting places with darker skies for \"starbathing\" experiences.There are some things you can only see at night, such as the aurora borealis, better known as the northern lights.

For example, bioluminescent beaches light up at night with the help of glowing sea creatures. These could be plankton in places like Jervis Bay in Australia, or firefly squid in Toyama Bay, Japan.A night safari can be a fun choice too, since many interesting animals are nocturnal.

Chiba is well known for big events like the Summer Sonic music festival and the Tokyo Game Show.Kumamoto, on the southern island of Kyushu, came in third for affordability, followed by the city of Okinawa — found on the island of the same name — and Hiroshima.But although it's an affordable city compared to other world cities, Tokyo didn't make JR Pass' top 10 rankings.

Enter the new king — Copenhagen.The Danish capital, known for its clean streets and cycling culture, is ranked the best city to live in on the Global Liveability Index 2025. Published by the Economist Intelligence Unit, the list ranked 173 cities across five categories: health care, education, infrastructure, stability, and culture and environment.Copenhagen got perfect scores for education, infrastructure and stability. It was one of just six cities to earn a perfect score for stability — the category with the most change in this year's rankings, and also the main reason Vienna lost its place at the top.The Austrian capital now shares second place with Zurich. It lost points in the stability category after two terror threats earlier this year — one at a train station, and another ahead of several Taylor Swift concerts, which resulted in three canceled shows.Stability also dropped across much of Europe, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.Still, Europe did well this year, with four cities in the top 10. Australia followed closely with three. Japan's Osaka was the only Asian city in the top 10, while Canada's Vancouver was the only one in North America.Calgary, in western Canada, saw the biggest fall, moving from fifth to 18th place after a drop in its health care score. However, Al Khobar in Saudi Arabia jumped 13 places thanks to improvements in health care and education.Honolulu, Hawaii, was the highest-ranked American city, at number 23. Tokyo ranked 13th, London 54th, and New York 69th.Not much has changed at the bottom of the list, however, with Damascus in Syria again ranking last — a place it has held for the past 12 years.",

In the city itself, visitors can see the Teatro Amazonas, a 19th-century theater. About 10 kilometers outside the city is the \"Meeting of Waters.\"  Here, two rivers — the dark Rio Negro and the lighter Rio Solimões — flow next to each other for about 6 kilometers without mixing.Manaus can also be the starting point for a trip into the Amazon rainforest, which visitors can even do as a day trip from the city.SalvadorThe city of Salvador, in the northeast of Brazil, was founded by the Portuguese in the 16th century. Many people were brought here from Africa as slaves, and Salvador now has many African influences in its food, music and religion.The old city center of Pelourinho is full of brightly colored buildings and churches. On Tuesday evenings, residents have religious celebrations and street parties with music and dancing.Fernando de NoronhaFernando de Noronha is a group of 21 islands about 360 kilometers from Brazil's northeast coast. Only one island has people living on it, and it's just 26 square kilometers in size. The island is home to Praia do Sancho, named one of Brazil's most beautiful beaches.

    "content": "When you're exercising, do you ever feel like the session is never going to end? You keep looking at the time, hoping it's almost over. But in fact, very little time has passed.According to new research, you may not be imagining it — difficult exercise sessions may actually affect how we perceive time.In a study by researchers in the UK and the Netherlands, 33 active adults did three 4-kilometer trials on an exercise bike. In the first trial, they cycled alone; in the second, they cycled with an avatar on the bike screen; and in the third, they raced against a virtual opponent.Before each trial, they were given a time perception task where they had to estimate when 30 seconds had passed. They were given the same task at different points during the trials, and again at the end.The results showed that, when given the task during the trial, participants overestimated how long they were cycling by about 10% — meaning they felt like they were cycling for longer than they really were. The effect was the same even when participants had to race against an opponent.So why does this happen?\"Exercise, particularly hard exercise, increases focus on the body, creating a heightened awareness of each moment,\" Andrew Edwards, one of the researchers, told The Guardian.Think about when you're doing something you enjoy — it feels like the time passes quickly. Here, the opposite is true: doing something you don't enjoy could make time feel like it's passing slowly.So, if you don't enjoy long sessions at the gym, the researchers say you could try finding ways to make exercise more enjoyable. Maybe add some music — or find a fun way to get your body moving that makes you feel like you're not doing exercise at all!",

It helps the cells stay healthy and work better.Apoptosis is when cells shut down and die when they are no longer useful, or are too badly damaged. This is normal, but it isn't good if it's happening too much.The researchers found that at the start of the week, the participants' cells were having a hard time. The autophagy process wasn't working as it should have been, and there was a little too much cell death.But by the end of the week, the autophagy process had gotten better and the cells weren't shutting down and dying — they were repairing themselves more instead.Kelli King, who was one of the researchers, said she was amazed at how quickly the cells had adapted to the cold baths.She said this shows that spending time in cold water could perhaps be used to help cells stay healthy for longer, and even prevent diseases.However, experts say people should always speak to their doctor before spending time in cold water!",

But many of those studies couldn't prove if pets caused those good effects, or if happier people were just more likely to get pets.To find out, the researchers looked at data from 2,500 households in the UK — specifically those who owned cats and dogs.The researchers used survey data that included information about each person's personality, which helped them check if some personality types were more likely to have pets and also feel happier.But even taking personality into account, the results showed that having a pet made people feel three to four points happier on a seven-point scale.Putting a dollar value on this happiness, the researchers found that owning a pet could bring the same level of life satisfaction as having an extra $90,000 a year.

And some studies even show that watching nature videos or looking at photos of nature can make people feel better.Now, a new study shows that you don't even have to see nature with your eyes — just imagining nature in your mind can help you relax too.In this study, 50 university students first completed a difficult task that caused stress. Then, researchers gave them nature-related words to imagine, such as \"mountain\" or \"forest,\" and city words, such as \"library\" or \"factory.\"The researchers then measured how relaxed the students felt, and checked their bodies for signs of stress.The results were clear: when students imagined nature, they felt more relaxed. Their heart rate slowed down and their heart rate variability went up — both signs of being more relaxed.Heart rate variability is the small change in time between each heartbeat. When this number goes up, it usually means the body is calm and not feeling stressed.The study also found that people who already liked nature felt even more relaxed when imagining it.The researchers say this could be useful for therapy. And for people who are unable to go outside — such as those in jail — just thinking about nature might still help.However, the study mostly included young adults, so more research is needed to see if it works for other groups of people.",

Start by walking for three minutes at high intensity. Then, walk for three minutes at a lower intensity. Repeat this for at least 30 minutes, four times a week.Japanese walking is becoming more popular online, but it's not new. It was developed by researchers from Shinshu University in Matsumoto, Japan. They did a study to test the health benefits of this type of walking in 2007.Participants were put into three groups. One group followed the Japanese walking routine, while the second group was told to walk at a moderate pace four times a week, with a goal of at least 8,000 steps a day. The third group didn't walk at all.The Japanese walking group had better results than the other two for things like blood pressure, leg muscle strength, fitness and decreased body weight.A different study also found that Japanese walking can slow the reductions in strength and fitness that happen with age.Of course, this type of exercise may not be suitable for everyone — and some people prefer to have a number of steps to work toward.

    "content": "If you want to live a happier, healthier life, there may be one simple thing you can do: trust people more.New research has found that people who trust others — whether it's friends, strangers, or even institutions — feel happier with their lives than those who don't.And the relationship goes both ways: trusting others makes us happier, but being happy makes us trust others more.To better understand the relationship between trust and well-being, researchers looked at nearly 1,000 studies involving more than 2.5 million people around the world.They looked at three different types of trust: trust in the people we know, like friends and family; trust in strangers and society in general; and trust in institutions such as the government and police.All three types of trust were connected to well-being, with trust in family and friends having the strongest impact.The researchers also found that trust is especially important for well-being in kids and teenagers, as well as in older adults.For young people, this could be because trust helps them build strong relationships, which is important for their well-being. For older adults, it matters again as they start to rely more on others for support.And where you live matters too. In countries where trust levels are high, especially trust in strangers and society — like Finland and Denmark — the connection between trust and happiness was found to be even stronger.Still, trusting others more is easier said than done.As Catrin Finkenauer, co-author of the study, said: \"Trust can't be forced — it has to be earned.\" She added that families, schools and governments all help create environments where trust — and well-being — can grow.",

But when it comes to getting fit, the 1,000th step and the 10,000th step are also pretty hard!So while starting exercise is hard, being consistent is even harder — and most people give up after just a few months.But a new study published in BMJ Open shows that using a smartwatch could help you keep active.In the study, 125 adults were asked to start a six-month exercise plan, and all participants got help from a coach by phone or video. Half of them also used a smartwatch, which tracked their heart rate and how active they were. The watch also sent messages, gave feedback and let participants contact their coach.The study found that people with smartwatches were 10 times more likely to start exercising regularly. And after six months, they were seven times more likely to still be doing it. Even a year later, they were three times more likely to still be exercising.But the researchers say just wearing a smartwatch isn't enough — what matters is how you use it.Other research has found that smartwatches work best when you follow a clear plan and build healthy habits.Experts say you should start with small, realistic goals, such as walking for 20 minutes each day. Use reminders on your watch or phone to help you stay consistent. Check your progress often, and notice how you improve — this can help you stay motivated.It also helps to share your goals with a friend or coach.

It serves coffee made from Australian-roasted beans, along with herbal teas, toasted sandwiches and cookies. Visitors can even buy the coffee beans to take home.Himeshima isn't the kind of place you'd expect to find Australian coffee.

Widmer says the locals have welcomed him, and the cafe has brought more visitors to the island, especially since tour groups started including Himeshima on their route.It's a big change from his life in Australia. Before coming to Japan, Widmer ran a swimming school with over 1,600 students a week, and before that he worked in television.\"Of course, there are always risks with any new venture or change of direction,\" Widmer says. \"But if you have a good belief and a good work ethic, then anything is possible to achieve.\"Widmer says he hopes to grow Ozi Cafe slowly and maybe even open more cafes in the future.

Servers go up too, so the full meal is enjoyed while floating above the city.From the air, diners can enjoy clear views of Tokyo Bay and the Rainbow Bridge while eating their food. The full event takes about one hour.The experience may sound a bit unusual, but the restaurant works to make it as safe as possible. Each guest must wear a safety harness like on a roller coaster, and everyone stays seated during the meal — because there is no floor under the table!Dinner in the Sky started in Belgium in 2006. Since then, it has been held over 10,000 times in more than 65 cities, including London, Dubai and Rome. Now, for the first time, it's happening in Tokyo.The Tokyo meal is served in Japanese bento boxes, and is a mix of Japanese and Western styles. The menu includes marinated shrimp, smoked salmon mousse, beef with coleslaw, root vegetables and a small chocolate cake. The dishes are made to be easy to eat while sitting in the air.The experience isn't cheap, though — daytime meals cost $250, and evening meals are $280.

They're the ones you complain to after a long meeting, laugh with during lunch, and team up with on projects.But a new study shows they might do even more — they could quietly influence whether you stay at your job or start thinking about leaving.Researchers from the University of South Florida and the University of Cincinnati followed 656 new employees at a global IT company over two years. These workers went through two months of training together before being sent to different project teams in cities across the US.By the end of the study, 27% of the new employees had left the company.Interestingly, when someone in the group that started together began looking for a new job, others often followed. Even employees who were happy at their job were more likely to consider quitting if a close friend from their starting group began job-hunting.The effect was strongest when the friendships were close, and those who spoke regularly and had strong bonds were more likely to follow each other's decisions.But this trend can be reduced by something simple — letting employees work in the city they prefer. When companies placed new workers in their chosen location, they were much less likely to be influenced by friends who were thinking about leaving.The study shows that work friends are more than just friendly faces — they can influence how you feel about your job and what decisions you make next!",

That's down from 48% in 2023.The most common working arrangement in the country is for workers to be at the office three days a week.The next most popular arrangement, according to the report, is that workers are given no minimum requirement for office attendance, but are encouraged to spend some time in the office.The report surveyed almost 1,000 companies across Australia, and most said they don't expect working arrangements to change over the next two years.Speaking to a number of Australian companies, ABC News found, perhaps not surprisingly, that people don't want to be forced to return to the office. However, they may not actually need to be forced back — many are happy to spend some time at their workplace.One manager, David Portway of NDE Solutions, said he finds that staff want to be in the office for meetings and to chat with colleagues.He believes that flexibility is important, which may mean allowing people to choose which days they work from home, or letting them come to the office after taking their children to school.",

They say American vehicles are too large for the busy streets and small parking spaces in Japanese cities, and that US cars are less reliable and less efficient.Data from the Japan Automobile Importers Association (JAIA) in 2024 shows that sales of imported foreign cars fell by 8.5% in Japan last year, with about 227,000 sold. About 4.4 million cars were sold in total, with almost one-third of them Toyotas.Among imported cars, German vehicles were the most popular with Japanese buyers.

You could eat the best food, travel the world and wear the most fashionable clothes — right?Of course a lot of rich people do those things, but if you look at some of the world's top CEOs, you'll see they wear the same simple clothes almost every day.Think of Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg, who has often been known to wear a simple gray t-shirt and pants. Steve Jobs, the co-founder of Apple, used to wear a black top with blue jeans and New Balance shoes.The reason? Zuckerberg once said that he wears the same outfits because he doesn't want to waste energy on life's small decisions.Former US President Barack Obama said something similar. \"I don't want to make decisions about what I'm eating or wearing,\" he told Vanity Fair in 2012. \"Because I have too many other decisions to make.\"It could be that they want to avoid something known as \"decision fatigue.\" This is the idea that every decision we make uses some energy, so we may get tired if we have to make a lot of them in one day. That could cause us to make decisions that aren't so good.But there could be a different reason. Writing for Forbes in 2017, Nick Hobson said these CEOs wear the same thing because they like to be in control. The rest of the time, their work includes a lot of uncertainty.So should we all start wearing the same thing every day? No, says writer Blake Snow. He believes that if you're not a millionaire CEO, a carefully chosen outfit is important because it can help you to make a good impression.",

    "content": "Remote Workers Feel Focused but Stressed: SurveyPeople who do all of their work remotely may be more productive, but they might also be less happy.That's according to a new report by the US survey company Gallup.Gallup spoke to workers around the world. It put workers into four groups: people who always worked remotely, people who had hybrid working arrangements, those who worked in an office but were able to work remotely if they wanted to, and those who worked in an office and could not work remotely.The survey found that remote workers were most likely to feel engaged in their work — meaning they were likely to be interested in and focused on what they were doing. Thirty-one percent of remote workers said they felt engaged.Among employees who always worked from an office, and were not able to work remotely, only 19% said they felt engaged.However, many fully remote workers reported feeling negative emotions in their lives.Forty-five percent of fully remote workers — and 46% of hybrid workers — said they felt stress. At least one-quarter of remote workers also reported feeling anger, loneliness and sadness.Remote workers were more likely to feel these things compared to people working from an office.Ryan Pendell from Gallup believes there are several reasons for this.The first, he said, is that people miss seeing their colleagues and doing things like having lunch together.Pendell added that it can also be stressful when you have to manage your time on your own, and people may also find it stressful to always be communicating with colleagues online.He said that companies should be thinking about the needs of all their employees, whether they're in the office or working from home.",

In other countries, you don't have to tip but it's nice to do if the service has been very good.And then there are some countries where tipping just isn't a part of the culture.This includes Japan, where a tip may even be refused, much to the surprise of the tourist offering it. However, a Japanese business has sparked debate by putting tip boxes in its restaurants.A photo taken in a Gyukatsu Motomura — a shop known for its beef cutlets that has 24 restaurants in Japan — has been shared online showing a plastic tip box by its cash register. The box says, \"Tip Box.  Thank you!!\" in English, and looks to be full of 1,000 yen and $5 bills.SoraNews24  writes that Gyukatsu Motomura actually put tip boxes in all of its restaurants in February 2024, except for those where the managers of the buildings the restaurants were in wouldn't allow them.  It says it did this because foreign visitors kept trying to give tips to staff.This was a problem because income tax would need to be paid on those tips. Japanese businesses usually file taxes for their workers, and Gyukatsu Motomura decided using a tip box would make it easier to manage those taxes.Some people online have said that the tip boxes are a good way for businesses to make more money from the increased tourism Japan has seen recently. Others, however, worry that tourists giving tips could make tipping normal and affect dining culture in Japan.",

The airport is in the city of Kitaakita in Akita prefecture, home prefecture of the Akita dog.The Akita dog has a history going back to the early 17th century, when it was used to hunt deer, boars and bears. They are medium-sized dogs, with big heads, pointy ears, deep eyes and curly tails.But the number of Akita dogs in Japan has been decreasing. In 2023, there were just over 1,800 Akita dogs in Japan, and they are not seen as often as they once were.Probably the most famous Akita dog was Hachiko. Born in 1923, Hachiko would walk with his owner to Tokyo's Shibuya Station every day, and then return to the station in the evening to wait for his owner's return.Hachiko's owner died suddenly, but Hachiko kept going to the station every day to wait for him. A statue of Hachiko is now a popular place to meet outside Shibuya Station, and Hachi: A Dog's Tale, a movie starring Richard Gere based on Hachiko's story, was a big hit in 2009.Akita dogs have been greeting passengers at Odate-Noshiro Airport on the eighth day of every month since 2016. The eighth day was chosen to honor Hachiko, because hachi means \"eight\" in Japanese.A male Akita dog called Rensui, and his sister Ruka, were made airport directors to further promote both the airport and Akita dogs.At a special event at the airport on May 18, Kensuke Ishida, the mayor of the nearby city of Odate, said he expected the two dogs to bring smiles to the faces of many people.",

They have Wi-Fi, coffee, desks, and even offer lunch.And according to Beijing Youth Daily, some of these places go even further — they give people fake tasks and even do pretend boss check-ins! If you pay more, you can even pretend to be a manager with your own office, or take part in a fake argument with your \"boss.\"And these \"pretend offices\" are actually becoming popular. For many, they offer more than just a place to spend time — they help people avoid awkward talks about being out of work.One woman, who calls herself Zonghua, told Spanish newspaper El País that she uses these fake offices because they're cheaper than spending every day in a cafe, and more comfortable than a library.Zonghua left her job in finance in 2024 because she was tired and wanted a quieter life. Now she's looking for work, but she hasn't told her family the truth. Every day she leaves the house as if she still has a job.China's youth unemployment rate is high — 16.5% for people aged 16 to 24 (not including students), and 7.2% among those 25 to 29 — which has made it hard for young adults to stay motivated.In a difficult job market, these quiet, fake offices are giving some people time — and space — to figure out what's next.",

And 45% also try to buy products in refillable containers, meaning they can take the containers back to the store and use them again.This aligns with data from Japan's Ministry of the Environment, which found that the number of plastic bags used decreased by about 50% between July 2020 and March 2022.The new survey was done by a sales company called Mitoriz, which also asked people about the ways they recycle.Most said they sort their waste and follow recycling rules, though almost 10% said they don't understand those rules.The survey also found that older people are more likely to take their own bags to stores and sort their recycling in the right way.However, plastic waste is still a big problem.

That app lets people buy cheap leftover food from local restaurants and grocery stores.Like the food app, Basch's new Poppins app helps people find items they need from people or businesses in their area. The idea is people can save money and space by renting things when they need them, instead of having to buy and keep them.It's also good for the planet, because by making more use of fewer things, we can reduce waste and save resources.And of course, people with things they're not using can make some money renting them out — or they can be kind and share them for free!Poppins was launched in France in April.

These hobbies can actually help your mind and body feel better.Emma Palmer-Cooper, a psychologist from the UK, told Good Housekeeping that having small goals, like learning a new hobby or finishing a project, gives us a sense of purpose. When we reach those goals, we feel happy and proud. This helps improve our mood and mental health.Science backs this up. A 2020 study from Princeton University found that gardening makes people feel as happy as eating at a restaurant or going for a walk. Another study from Kansas State University in 2009 showed that gardening helps older adults feel better about themselves.Bird-watching is another great activity. A 2022 study found that seeing or hearing birds can improve your mood — even for people with depression.Drawing is also a fun and creative way to help your mental health. Research has shown that just 10 minutes of drawing a day can lift your mood. And if you keep doing it for a month, the effects are even stronger.These hobbies don't just improve your mental health, either — experts say they also keep your brain healthy.When you learn something new, like knitting, your brain becomes more active.

But when her interest in Pokemon grew into something bigger, she left her old job to follow her passion.Now, Webb is the owner of Collector's Cardhouse in Chorleywood, a quiet village just northwest of London, England.Webb and her husband, Harry, started out selling Pokemon cards online. But when people started staying at home more during the coronavirus pandemic, interest in collecting Pokemon cards grew — and so did their business.Now, she runs her shop, as well as a YouTube channel called PokiChloe, which has more than 125,000 subscribers.Customers bring their cards into the shop to find out what they're worth. A big part of this is called \"grading.\"  This is when experts check a card's condition and give it a grade from one to 10.If a card has no marks or damage, it could get a 10 — a perfect grade. Cards with a perfect grade are hard to find and often more valuable.One of the rarest cards that was brought into Webb's shop was a Charizard card that was only given to employees at Creatures, one of the companies behind Pokemon.  Charizard is a dragon-like Pokemon that is very popular among fans, and only around 300 of these cards were made.Webb's card had a perfect grade, and was sold for around $53,000.",

In fact, a study done earlier this year found that 38% of US adults — and especially younger adults — need background noise to help them fall asleep.Experts say, however, that there are some things to remember if this is part of your bedtime routine.Speaking with CNN, UK sleep expert Lindsay Browning said you should choose something that's not very engaging, so it won't keep your brain awake — a sleep story, for example, or a TV show you've already seen, so there are no surprises.You can also try listening to a steady sound, instead of one that changes a lot — like white noise or the sound of rain falling. This is especially helpful if you live in a noisy area.Experts say you should also use a timer that turns the sound off after some time, because listening to something all night could cause you to wake up.So a podcast might not be a good idea — unless it's one you've already heard before!",

But the reason for the race was to raise awareness about the risk of cheetahs becoming an endangered species.The rugby player started 50 meters ahead of the cheetah, but got to the finish at about the same time as the animal — because while Habana was fast, humans just can't compete with many animals!There are a number of reasons for this. There's evolution, of course, and the fact that many animals have four legs, as well as their running style and the shapes of their bodies.So which land animals are the fastest?The cheetah is famous for being the world's fastest land animal. It has a top speed of around 114 kilometers per hour. However, it can only run fast over short distances — about 400 meters.According to the Conservation Africa website, they're fast because they're quite light, and they have flexible spines, small heads and long legs.The next fastest land animal is the pronghorn, or American antelope, which can run at speeds of almost 90 kilometers per hour. Pronghorns are very light, with large hearts and lungs that make them strong runners. Pronghorns can actually keep going at high speeds longer than cheetahs can!The springbok, the national animal of South Africa — its rugby team is known as the Springboks — can run at a similar speed, while gazelles and wildebeest are only a little slower.But Britannica says there's another important reason why many animals are so good at running fast: they have to be.They spend a lot more time running after prey — or running away from predators — than humans do!",

If the ball hits another surface before bouncing on the ground, it's out.The sport started in 1969 in Mexico, after a man named Enrique Corcuera created the first padel court at his home. He liked tennis, but he didn't have enough space for a full-size tennis court. His wife, Viviana, wrote the first rules for the game and gave them to her husband as a birthday present.In the 1970s, Prince Alfonso of Spain visited Corcuera's home and liked the game so much that he built padel courts at a hotel he owned in Spain. Around the same time, Julio Menditeguy, a member of the prince's tennis club, took the game back to his home country of Argentina.From there, the sport grew quickly in South America and Europe.By the 1980s, padel reached more countries like Brazil, France and the US, and the first international match took place in 1988 between Spain and Argentina. In 1991, the International Padel Federation was created, and the first World Padel Championship was held the year after.Today, padel is played in over 140 countries by about 30 million players. It's a sport that's easy to understand and fun to play!",

    "content": "Seven out of 10 people in Japan support the idea of having a female emperor, according to a new survey by The Mainichi Shimbun.Japanese law says that a woman cannot inherit the throne, but many people believe that it's time for that to change.In fact, only 6% of the people surveyed said they did not support the idea of a female emperor — and the rest of the 2,045 participants said they weren't sure.The question has been asked a number of times over the years, and surveys have usually shown that many Japanese people would be happy to have a woman on the throne.Part of the reason why the question is now so important is that there is only one male heir to the throne. That's 18-year-old Prince Hisahito, the only son of Prince Akishino and Princess Kiko. Emperor Naruhito only has a daughter, Princess Aiko.At times, support for a female emperor has been as high as almost 90%. And the current lower figure of 70% could be linked to Hisahito entering adulthood.Some hope that Aiko might one day become empress, and the 23-year-old has been doing some official duties.However, Japanese law says that if a female member of the royal family marries someone who is not a royal, they themselves are no longer considered a royal.This means their children, whether male or female, are not considered heirs to the throne.The survey also found that 66% of Japanese people are interested in the royal family. Older people were much more likely to be interested in the royals, with 82% of those aged 70 and above saying they were interested.But just 50% of people aged between 18 and 29 said they were interested.",

But have you ever thought they might be … linked, somehow?Well, the \"Pixar Theory\" is a fan-made idea that links every Pixar movie into one big story.It was first introduced in 2013 by Jon Negroni, who said the characters, worlds and stories in each film may actually be part of a single timeline.The timeline begins with The Good Dinosaur, a movie that's set in a world where the asteroid that was supposed to kill the dinosaurs misses the Earth. Because of this, dinosaurs have time to learn to farm, raise families, and show feelings like love. This is one of the first signs of animals becoming more like humans in Pixar's world.Next is the movie Brave, where a witch uses magic to turn people into animals — and also makes objects act like people. As time goes on, all animals grow smarter. By the time of Ratatouille, a rat can cook food, and in Up, dogs talk using special collars.Humans change too. In The Incredibles, some people have superpowers. But machines soon take over. In Wall-E, Earth is filled with trash, and humans leave for space — leaving Cars to take over the world.Then, according to the Pixar Theory, Monsters, Inc. actually happens in the far future. And the doors the monsters use to enter children's rooms and scare them are actually going to the past!Boo, the little girl from Monsters, Inc., then learns how to use those doors to go back in time — and becomes the witch in Brave, linking the beginning and end of the timeline!Pixar has said the Pixar Theory isn't real, but many fans still enjoy thinking about it.

He put his own money into the project and also received government grants.The \"12 Neighbours Community\" now provides subsidized housing for people who were previously homeless. Each tiny home has a kitchen, a bathroom, a living room that is also used as a bedroom, and solar panels on the roof.A home in the 12 Neighbours Community costs nearly $60,000 to build, while the average price of affordable housing in Canada is about $255,000.The community also has gardens, shops, a cafe, and workshops where residents can learn new skills. LeBrun sees giving residents the opportunity to work as an important part of helping them become independent.And LeBrun isn't finished.His next project, called \"Neighbourly Homes,\" aims to provide housing that can be built more quickly, as it's needed.

Fleming created the famous secret agent James Bond, known as 007.Fleming died in 1964, when only the first three Bond films — with Sean Connery as 007 — had been released. But the character lives on to this day.So who was the man behind the spy?Ian Fleming was born into a rich family in London in 1908. But his father died in World War I when Ian was a child.Ian first went to school in England, then went to university in Austria, Switzerland and Germany. He later worked as a writer in Moscow and in a London bank.But it was during wartime that he's likely to have gotten the idea for Bond. He's said to have based the character on a number of people he met during World War II, when he worked as an intelligence officer in the British navy.Bond was first seen in the 1953 novel Casino Royale, which Fleming wrote while at his summer house in Jamaica. The name of the house was \"Goldeneye,\" which would also become the title of a 1995 Bond movie.By the time he died at age 56, Fleming had written 12 Bond novels and two collections of short stories. They quickly became popular — even US President John F. Kennedy said he enjoyed them.There was more to Fleming than just 007, however. He also wrote the children's story Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, which was made into a popular movie in 1968.But he will always be associated with his British spy — and the movies that still make hundreds of millions of dollars around the world.Bronze bust of Fleming by sculptor Anthony Smith.",

No, this was the name of the controversial ball those players would be using.It was controversial because quite a lot of players said it was too unpredictable — they didn't know what it would do in the air, especially when it was kicked hard.Brazilian goalkeeper Julio Cesar called it \"horrible.\"So what was the problem with the ball?Soccer balls are supposed to be round, but this one — made by Adidas — was said to be the roundest ever made.Some older balls had stitches that you could see on the outside, but not the Jabulani.This meant it was very round. And the outside of the ball was also very smooth.The smoothness of a soccer ball affects how air moves around it when it's kicked. A smooth ball has a surface that lets air flow evenly at first, but as the ball goes faster, the air can suddenly become unstable and separate from the ball.When the air separates, the ball's movement can become unpredictable, making it wobble. It does this when it gets to something called its \"critical speed.\"NASA even tested the Jabulani ball and found that it got to its critical speed at about 80 kilometers per hour, which is about the speed of a hard shot by a soccer player.When it was hit hard, it was more likely to wobble. That's why Brazil's goalkeeper was worried!Since 2010, scientists have made the balls less smooth, and more predictable.  And players have stopped complaining — well, about the ball, at least!",

Ice melts, coolers are heavy, and your refrigerator is probably far away.Wouldn't it be great if your drink could just chill itself?Well, the Cool Can can do just that!The Cool Can is a self-cooling can invented by James Vyse of Wales, who used to work as a bartender. He never studied engineering, but he spent years experimenting to create a can that chills a drink in minutes.The Cool Can works by pushing a button on the bottom of the can. The outside of the can gets colder right away, and after a few minutes, the drink inside is ice cold too.This works because of a special layer of crystals inside the can's walls. When you push the button, water is released, which mixes with the crystals. This creates a reaction that absorbs heat, making the drink inside cold.As well as being easy to use, the Cool Can could also help reduce the need for refrigerators, which use 17% of the world's electricity, according to the United Nations. Plus, unlike plastic bottles, aluminum cans are easy to recycle, and the Cool Can can be recycled just like any other can.The idea is already quite popular. A survey of 100 university students by Vyse's company, Delta H Innovations, found that 81% would choose a self-cooling can over a normal one when drinking on the go, while 73% would be happy to pay more if it meant their drink was cold.Vyse is already talking to drink companies like Coca-Cola and Red Bull, and if all goes well, his cans could be on sale by 2026.",

But a group of researchers from Finland believes there may actually be many billions more people on Earth.In a study published this March in Nature Communications, they said that previous population estimates could have been off by as much as 84%!They said that this was most likely to have happened because of poor population estimates in rural areas, where it's hard to know how many people actually live.Of course, counting people isn't easy for a lot of different reasons.Many estimates use something called \"gridded population data.\"This divides the world into grids, with estimates made for each grid square based on census data and other information.But the researchers said this works better in towns and cities than it does in rural areas.They compared the data used from these large datasets with other, smaller datasets taken in 35 countries around the world.These smaller datasets only looked at population numbers for people who had been moved from their homes so that dams could be built.These numbers were thought to be more reliable because dam companies had paid for the people to be moved.When the researchers compared the datasets, they found a lot of differences, which suggested that the global population estimates that are used around the world every day are likely to be much smaller than the real number.It's very important to have accurate information, they said, so governments can provide services for people in rural areas.",

    "title": "Japan's Latest Gadget Makes Writing Fun Again",
    "content": "In a world full of screens and smartphones, using a pen can feel slow and old-fashioned. Why write by hand when using a keyboard is faster?But one new device from Japan is making writing fun again — by making it into a game!The Otona no Yaruki Pen, or \"Motivation Pen for Grown-ups,\" is made by Kokuyo, a company in Osaka.Although it's called a pen, it's actually a small device that attaches to a normal pen or pencil. It has sensors inside that feel vibrations when you write, and the more you write, the more your \"motivation power\" builds up. The device even changes color the longer you write.And when the device is connected to a smartphone, your \"motivation power\" turns into points that you can use to play a game on the app.Kokuyo first made a similar pen in 2019, called the Shukudai Yaruki Pen (\"Homework Motivation Pen\"). The pen was made to encourage children to do their homework, but after hearing that many adults were using it as well, the company decided to make one just for adults.The new pen was first sold through a crowdfunding site called Makuake. Kokuyo hoped to raise 500,000 yen, or about $3,300, for the device. But after just eight hours, Kokuyo had raised around 35 million yen — about $230,000!Thanks to this success, Kokuyo now plans to sell the pen on its website. So if you've been having a difficult time staying motivated while writing, this pen might be just what you need!",

But it could also be a good description for a weasel!Weasels are small, carnivorous animals found in many parts of the world. Their bodies are usually under 30 centimeters long, and they weigh under 350 grams.Some are even smaller — like the \"least weasel,\" which weighs as little as 25 grams! This makes them about the same size as, or smaller than, some of their prey, like mice and birds.Here are some more fun facts about these little animals!They're sneakyWeasels take over their prey's nests after they kill them.It's also been believed that weasels can make a small hole in an egg to eat what's inside, but leave the shell almost in one piece — so you can't tell the egg is empty. Though we're not sure if weasels really do this!But people think weasels are sneaky. And the phrase \"to weasel out of something\" can be used when someone doesn't do something they said they were going to do — often by finding a sneaky way to get out of it.They do a 'war dance'When weasels hunt, they aren't just sneaky and quick — they've even been seen doing a \"war dance.\"  They jump around and make quick movements, which scientists believe might be a way of confusing their prey before they kill them.They save their leftoversWeasels can eat about half of their weight in 24 hours. And since they're so small, this often means they catch more than they need to eat!So weasels save their leftovers by making holes in the ground near where they sleep — just like a little fridge!

    "content": "Many studies have been done on the possible negative effects of technology use among people of different ages.One concern is what has been called \"digital dementia\" — the idea that using too much technology could, over time, cause memory problems and cognitive decline.But a new study challenges that idea, finding that older people who use smartphones and other devices show lower rates of cognitive decline.Researchers in the US looked at 57 published studies, which included data from over 411,000 adults. Each study looked at the use of digital technology, and included cognitive tests or diagnoses.Technology use in the studies included things like smartphones, computers, social media, internet and email. The participants' average age was 68 at the beginning of the studies.And the results showed that greater technology use among older adults was associated with a 42% lower risk of cognitive decline.There could be different reasons for this, the researchers said — for example, using technology could help keep the brain active. Another reason could be that technology helps older adults stay connected with other people — and many studies have shown that loneliness affects cognition later in life.However, some say more research is needed, because the studies didn't look at how each person was using technology or how long they used it for.The researchers also noted that people in this age group started using technology later in life, when their brains were already fully formed, so it's not clear if the same effect would be seen among people who have used this technology for most of their lives.Still, it's a good starting point for better understanding ways to stop or slow cognitive decline — especially in a world that has nearly 10 million new cases of dementia a year, according to the World Health Organization.",

Having grown up with smartphones, they're probably more afraid of being disconnected and having to spend time without a working device.Of course, there are some things you can do to make your battery last longer, and most phones let you turn on battery saver mode to help that charge last a little longer.If you want to make small savings, Google says you can also try reducing screen brightness, turning off keyboard sounds or turning on dark mode.",

From age 3, she has been a resident at the University of California, Santa Cruz's Long Marine Laboratory, where researchers have tested her ability to recognize rhythms.Few animals show a clear ability to recognize and move to a beat aside from humans, parrots and some monkeys. But what is interesting about Ronan is that she can dance without knowing how to sing or talk musically.\"Scientists once believed that only animals who were vocal learners — like humans and parrots — could learn to find a beat,\" said Hugo Merchant, a researcher at Mexico's Institute of Neurobiology, who was not part of the Ronan research.But in the years since Ronan became famous, scientists have questioned whether she can still dance, and whether she was better than people at keeping a beat.The results of a new study are clear: Ronan still has it, and she's better than ever.In the study, researchers focused on drum beats in a laboratory. They filmed Ronan bobbing her head as a drummer played at 112, 120 and 128 beats per minute. Two of those beats were new to Ronan, so scientists could test her ability to recognize new rhythms.The researchers then asked 10 college students to do the same.\"No human was better than Ronan at all the different ways we test quality of beat-keeping,\" said Peter Cook, one of the researchers.

One tube had a swab with the scent of the cat's owner. Another held a swab with the scent of a stranger. The third was a clean swab with no smell.The cats spent more time sniffing the swabs with the stranger's scent than those with their owner's scent or the clean swab. This shows that the cats recognized that the smell was new, and not from someone they knew.Cats often use smell and scents to recognize and communicate with other cats. And in earlier studies, kittens also sniffed female cats they didn't know for longer than they sniffed their own mothers. So cats notice what's new, and take their time checking it out.After sniffing, some cats rubbed their faces on the tubes. This is a marking behavior, and means the cats may have been reacting to the smell or marking the tube with their own scent.The study shows that cats can tell the difference between smells from humans they know and smells from those they don't know.However, the researchers say it's still unclear if cats can recognize specific people just by smell, and more tests are needed to answer that question.For now, your cat might not know it's you by your smell alone — but they do know you're not a stranger!",

A human hair is between 17 and 120 microns wide, so this violin is even smaller than that!But the researchers from Loughborough University won't be playing this violin.  In fact, it's really just an outline of a violin drawn using platinum, and not a real instrument.It was created to test the university's new nanolithography system. Lithography is the process used to draw the patterns on the circuits we use in our phones and computers — and nanolithography does this on a very small scale!It's hoped that more research with the system might help us create more efficient computers, or even find better ways to collect energy.Kelly Morrison, head of the physics department at Loughborough University, said that while creating the world's smallest violin may seem like fun and games, the system is already being used to research more efficient ways of storing data.But perhaps there was some fun involved — the team decided to create a violin because of the popular saying, \"Can you hear the world's smallest violin playing just for you?\"This is usually said to mock someone who's complaining about something that isn't really worth complaining about.
