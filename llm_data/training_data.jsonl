However, nobody really knew how it started to grow, so nori farmers would just put nets in the water and hope the seaweed would grow on it. Nori came to be called \"lucky grass,\" or ungusa.Kathleen Drew took the luck out of nori farming without ever going to Japan.Drew, who was from the UK, was a botanist who specialized in seaweed. On a trip to Wales in 1949, she went to a beach and collected a type of seaweed called laver, which is very similar to nori.Back in her laboratory, she put seashells in some of her laver samples, and a red type of seaweed started growing on the shells.Until then, scientists had believed this was a different type of seaweed. But Drew discovered that it was actually the same seaweed as laver, just in an early part of its life.When Japanese botanists read about Drew's discovery, it helped them find a way to start growing nori in tanks on land before moving it to the sea. This allowed farmers to grow nori consistently, and even allowed the seaweed to be grown in parts of Japan where it hadn't been possible before.Off the island of Kyushu in southwestern Japan, the Ariake Sea is the biggest nori-producing area of Japan. And in Uto city, Kumamoto prefecture, nori farmers who worked on the sea were so thankful for Drew's discovery that they built a monument for her, and every year in April they still hold a ceremony for her."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"summary_questions\": [\"When did Kathleen Drew collect laver in Wales?\", \"What happened when Drew put seashells in some of her laver samples?\", \"What is Japan's biggest nori-producing area?\"], \"discuss_questions\": [\"What are your thoughts on Kathleen Drew's discovery?\", \"Have you heard of Drew before?\", \"Have you ever tried growing your own food?\", \"What are the most important ingredients in your country's cuisine?\", \"What traditional foods from your country would you recommend trying?\"]}"}]}

At present, just two in five new homes in England have solar panels.According to government plans, rooftop solar panels would have to cover 40% of the area covered by a new building. Around 80% of new homes would need to follow this rule, while 19% could have fewer solar panels because of the shape of the roof, or for other reasons such as the location of the building.Just 1% of new homes are likely to have no solar panels.The new rule will probably add between around $4,400 and $5,300 to the cost of building a new home.

Fifty-eight percent of those people said they'd borrowed $500 or more during 2024.More than 3,500 people took part in the survey, which was done by polling company Gallup and a group called West Health.Tim Lash from West Health told CBS that people in the US are being forced to reduce spending on groceries or even stop paying rent just to afford health care.Lash said it was \"concerning,\" and things need to change.The US is known for having high health care costs. According to USA Today, there are a number of reasons why Americans have to pay so much.It said there are no price limits on medicine, specialists get paid a lot, and administrative costs are high.Some Americans get medical insurance from their companies, but for those who don't, things can be very difficult.In 2010, the US government introduced the Affordable Care Act, which was designed to make it easier for people to pay for health care. But according to the survey, it hasn't done enough for some Americans.Borrowing for health care last year was most common among younger adults. Eighteen percent of those aged 18 to 29 said they borrowed money, while this was true for 17% of people in their 30s and 16% of those in their 40s.Only 2% of people aged 65 and over said they borrowed money for health care.

But instead of traveling to Shanghai, it turned back and landed in San Francisco at 5 p.m., according to website FlightAware.One of the passengers, Yang Shuhan, told CNN the pilot sounded \"very frustrated\" when he announced that the plane would have to turn around because of his forgotten passport.But he wasn't the only one who was frustrated.

Almost half of the participants (47%) said they find it difficult to focus at work just before a vacation.Losing focus at work doesn't mean someone is lazy — they might just really need a break! And as many as 75% of American workers say they've had \"brain fog,\" meaning they're not able to think clearly, which could be a sign of burnout.The survey also asked about the warning signs for needing time off.Feeling \"burnt out\" was at the top of the list, with 62% of participants identifying it as a warning sign. Daydreaming about escaping was chosen by 45%, while getting annoyed with others was chosen by 44%.Also, 39% named feeling tired — even after getting enough sleep — as how they know it's time for a vacation. Thirty-five percent identified having low energy even on weekends as their sign.There's nothing like taking time off to help with burnout. But while we wait for our vacation, there are other things we can do to feel better and stay focused.The Mayo Clinic's advice is to find relaxing activities like yoga to do outside of work so you get a break from stress.

That's the same as the number of horses that arrive every spring to give carriage tours during the tourist season!Around 80% of the island is part of Mackinac Island State Park, where visitors can enjoy over 110 kilometers of hiking trails.And after all that exercise, guests might want to try some of Mackinac Island's famous fudge! The island's fudge shops make more than 4,500 kilograms of it every day during the busy season.The most common way to get to Mackinac Island is by boat.

The fires destroyed much of the town of Lahaina, and more than 100 people died.Speaking with The Associated Press, Green said the increase is small enough that tourists won't feel the difference. He added that, since many people go to Hawaii for its natural environment, he believes many won't mind paying a little extra to protect it.However, counties in Hawaii also charge a different accommodation tax of 3%, and there is a further 4.7% tax on most goods and services. This means visitors to Hawaii will pay a nearly 19% tax for their hotels — one of the highest rates in the country.Speaking with The Guardian, John Pele from the Maui Hotel and Lodging Association worried that the Hawaiian government may be taxing tourists out of wanting to visit at all.Almost 10 million people visited Hawaii in 2023, spending more than $20 billion on the islands."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"summary_questions\": [\"When will the new legislation take effect?\", \"Why does Governor Green believe many won't mind paying the extra tax?\", \"How many people visited Hawaii in 2023?\"], \"discuss_questions\": [\"What are your thoughts on Hawaii increasing its accommodation tax?\", \"Do you agree that tourists won't mind paying the extra tax?\", \"Have you been to Hawaii?\", \"Have you been to any countries with a high tourist tax?\", \"Has your country made any changes to its tourist tax in recent years?\"]}"}]}

The malls can use more of their space, and the new apartments mean people live right by the restaurants and stores, which they're now more likely to use.Some of the country's many malls have found it hard to make money with more competition from online stores.However, Jacob Knudsen, from the real estate company Macerich, told CNBC that he believes \"the mall is becoming cool again.\"Knudsen's company is adding housing to the FlatIron Crossing Mall in Colorado. As well as housing, some malls are building things like pickleball courts and medical centers. So these large spaces are no longer just places to go shopping.Of course, not everyone would like the idea of living in a mall, and some people are worried that apartments will increase traffic congestion in these areas.But CNN reports that mall apartments are popular among young people and single adults, who can have everything in one place, along with a ready-made community."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"summary_questions\": [\"How many US malls had plans to add housing in January 2022?\", \"What are some of the advantages of adding housing to malls?\", \"Why have some US malls found it hard to make money recently?\"], \"discuss_questions\": [\"What are your thoughts on malls adding apartments to their sites?\", \"Could you see yourself living in a mall?\", \"Do you think mall apartments could be popular in your country?\", \"Is there a housing shortage in your town or city?\", \"Do you live walking-distance to restaurants and shops?\"]}"}]}

He said he wasn't sure if the machine made a mistake, or if someone had added two extra zeros.When he returned home, he asked his bank for his money back. But the bank said no.
