Hundreds of opposition supporters protested outside the parliament building during the session.Videos from inside the building showed clashes between lawmakers, and flares and smoke bombs being thrown. Serbian media said eggs and water bottles also were thrown.Officials later said three people were injured in the disturbance, including lawmaker Jasmina Obradovic, who was taken to hospital.Defense Minister Bratislav Gasic described those behind the incident as ""a disgrace to Serbia.""Serbia's populist President Aleksandar Vucic visited Obradovic in hospital. ""Jasmina will win, Serbia will win,"" Vucic said in a post on Instagram, showing him holding the lawmaker's hand in an emergency room.The incident reflects a deep political crisis in Serbia where a series of anti-corruption protests have rattled a populist government.Vucevic resigned in January as the government faced protests over the collapse in November of a concrete train station roof in Serbia's north that killed 15 people and which critics blamed on government corruption.Parliament must confirm the prime minister's resignation for it to take effect.A rise in education funding has been one of the demands by Serbia's protesting students who have been a key driving force behind almost daily street protests that started after the November 1 roof collapse in Novi Sad.Opposition parties have insisted that the government has no authority to pass new laws.Vucic and his ruling right-wing Serbian Progressive Party have imposed a firm grip on power in the past decades despite formally seeking European Union membership.","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on the incident in Serbia's parliament?2.How familiar are you with the political situation in Serbia?3.Have there been any similar cases of political unrest or violence in your country?4.Are political protests common where you live?5.Do you think protesting is an effective way to bring about political change?","Exercise 4Further Discussion Have a discussion based on the following questions.1.What political issues have been making headlines in your country lately?2.How has public opinion of your country's current government changed since it took power?3.What are your biggest complaints about your country's government?4.Would you ever consider going into politics?5.When tyranny becomes law, rebellion becomes duty. — Thomas Jefferson.

But the troupe has reinvented itself by adapting its repertoire, transforming its space into a hub for art and wartime volunteer work, and casting women in most roles.The theater's predominantly female actors and staff spend much of their time supporting Ukrainian soldiers, weaving camouflage nets in the theater before opening the doors to audiences at night.The team also regularly raises funds to supply their colleagues with necessary kit for the front lines. But some of those colleagues will never return to the stage: one was killed and two more have gone missing.While Chernihiv remains under Ukrainian control, it has suffered during the war; Russian strikes remain frequent.A significant number of cultural and artistic institutions in the Chernihiv region have been destroyed or severely damaged, according to Oksana Tunik-Fryz from the local arts council.""The enemy is destroying us from within by destroying our culture,"" she said.""Killing a Ukrainian is killing a person.

Around 900,000 Botox injections are done in the UK every year.While Botox is used to treat some health problems, like managing pain, Botox injections are best known for being used to get rid of wrinkles. Botox keeps muscles relaxed and the skin above smooth, but this can also reduce people's ability to make certain expressions.Mark Rothman, owner of The Top Secret Comedy Club, explained the Botox ban, saying, ""Comedy thrives on connection, and facial expressions play a huge part.  We want people to laugh, cry, frown, sneer, but frozen faces from Botox impact the entire atmosphere.""Staff working at the club's door will now do an ""Expression Test"" before letting people in.

Besides Finland, Denmark, Iceland and Sweden remain the top four and in the same order.Country rankings were based on answers people give when asked to rate their own lives.Researchers say that besides money and health, some factors that influence happiness seem simple: sharing meals with others, having somebody to rely on for social support, and household size. In Mexico and Europe, for example, a household size of four to five people predicts the highest levels of happiness, the study said.Believing in the kindness of others is also closely tied to happiness, according to the study.As an example, the report suggests that people believing that others would return their lost wallet is a good sign of a population's general level of happiness.Nordic countries rank among the top places for expected and actual return of lost wallets, the study found.Overall, researchers said global evidence on the expected and actual return of lost wallets shows that people are generally kinder than we think — actual rates of wallet return are around twice as high as people expect.While European countries dominate the happiness top 20, there were some exceptions. Costa Rica came in at sixth place, and Mexico entered the top 10 for the first time.When it comes to decreasing happiness the United States has dropped to its lowest-ever position at 24, having previously peaked at 11th place in 2012.

About $11,300 has been budgeted for it.If successful, local officials could expand the program to other artistic activities like theater or dance, Courcier Delafontaine said.Marianne de Reynier Nevsky, the cultural mediation manager in the town of 46,000 who helped devise the program, said many types of patients could benefit.""It could be a person with depression, a person who has trouble walking, a person with a chronic illness,"" she said.Dr. Marc-Olivier Sauvain at the Neuchatel Hospital Network, said he had already prescribed museum visits to two patients to help them get in better shape before a planned operation.His focus is on patients who have lost the habit of going out. He wants them to get moving.""I think that these patients will fully benefit from museum prescriptions.

And that shortage has pushed prices up by as much as 44% over the past 10 years, according to property website Idealista.Others have complained that overtourism has put too much pressure on public services, and that it's the locals who are suffering.In Madrid, organizers said as many as 150,000 people joined the protests, although authorities said the numbers were much lower. The crowds shouted, ""Get Airbnb out of our neighborhoods,"" according to Euronews.It has been reported that some local authorities have listened to the protesters, and canceled plans to build new tourist properties.But on the hugely popular island of Mallorca, where locals have been protesting for months, protest organisers have blamed the situation on the greed of hotel owners, politicians and landlords.Some islanders said tourists should not visit Mallorca this year.But the island and the country are likely to be busy once again.

However, nobody really knew how it started to grow, so nori farmers would just put nets in the water and hope the seaweed would grow on it. Nori came to be called ""lucky grass,"" or ungusa.Kathleen Drew took the luck out of nori farming without ever going to Japan.Drew, who was from the UK, was a botanist who specialized in seaweed. On a trip to Wales in 1949, she went to a beach and collected a type of seaweed called laver, which is very similar to nori.Back in her laboratory, she put seashells in some of her laver samples, and a red type of seaweed started growing on the shells.Until then, scientists had believed this was a different type of seaweed. But Drew discovered that it was actually the same seaweed as laver, just in an early part of its life.When Japanese botanists read about Drew's discovery, it helped them find a way to start growing nori in tanks on land before moving it to the sea. This allowed farmers to grow nori consistently, and even allowed the seaweed to be grown in parts of Japan where it hadn't been possible before.Off the island of Kyushu in southwestern Japan, the Ariake Sea is the biggest nori-producing area of Japan. And in Uto city, Kumamoto prefecture, nori farmers who worked on the sea were so thankful for Drew's discovery that they built a monument for her, and every year in April they still hold a ceremony for her.","Exercise 3QuestionsAnswer the following questions about the article.1.When did Kathleen Drew collect laver in Wales?2.What happened when Drew put seashells in some of her laver samples? 3.What is Japan's biggest nori-producing area?","Exercise 4DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on Kathleen Drew's discovery? 2.Have you heard of Drew before?

His entire life was dedicated to the service of the Lord and of his Church,″ Farrell said.Francis, who suffered from chronic lung disease and had part of one lung removed as a young man, was admitted to Gemelli hospital on February 14 for a severe lung infection that developed into double pneumonia. He spent 38 days there.But he emerged on Easter Sunday — his last public appearance, a day before his death — to bless thousands of people in St. Peter's Square followed by a surprise drive through the square, drawing wild cheers from the crowd.Francis performed the blessing from the same balcony where he was introduced to the world on March 13, 2013 as the 266th pope.After that rainy night 12 years ago, the Argentine-born Jorge Mario Bergoglio brought a breath of fresh air into a 2,000-year-old institution. In his first meeting with journalists he said he wanted a ""poor church that is for the poor.""He was the first pope to name himself after the 13th century Saint Francis of Assisi, who was known for his personal simplicity, message of peace, and care for nature and society's outcasts.Pope Francis sought out the unemployed, the sick, the disabled and the homeless.

Germany was third, at $1,638.Kinglike ranked 20 European countries, and among them Malta was found to be the most expensive destination for a luxury holiday. A week-long trip there could cost almost $4,300.That's partly because five-star accommodation in Malta came out as the most expensive of all — at $1,627.By contrast, you could get a week in a top Turkish hotel for just $330, according to Kinglike's research.","Exercise 3QuestionsAnswer the following questions about the article.1.What does the estimated price for a luxury holiday in Greece include?2.What's the second-cheapest luxury destination in Europe, according to Kinglike?3.How much could a week-long luxury trip to Malta cost?","Exercise 4DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on Kinglike's findings?2.How important is comfort and luxury to you when you travel?3.What's the nicest accommodation you ever stayed in?

But when the tunnel is completed, a drive between the islands will take just 10 minutes. Rail travel between Hamburg in Germany and the Danish capital Copenhagen will also be reduced from 5 hours to 2.5 hours.Most undersea tunnels — like the Seikan Tunnel that links the Japanese islands of Honshu and Hokkaido — are dug through the rock under the seafloor.However, the seafloor under the Baltic Sea is too soft to dig a tunnel.Instead, separate sections of the tunnel are first built, then immersed 40 meters under the sea, placed into a trench that has been dug on the seafloor, and joined together one by one.Each of the steel-reinforced concrete sections is 217 meters long, 42 meters wide and weighs 73,000 metric tons. And there will be 90 sections.When completed in 2029, it will be 18 kilometers long, and the world's longest immersed tunnel.Inside the tunnel will be five tubes running side-by-side. Two tubes will contain railway lines, two will contain roads, and the fifth will be for maintenance and emergencies.The Fehmarnbelt tunnel is part of a European Union (EU) plan to improve transport across Europe and reduce flying. In Denmark, people hope it will make their country more accessible and increase tourism, and it should make travel to the wider Scandinavian region easier too.The cost of building the tunnel is around $8.1 billion. The EU provided some funds for the tunnel, but Denmark has paid most of the cost, which it hopes to make back in toll fees over the next 40 years.","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on the construction of the Fehmarnbelt tunnel?2.Have you traveled in an undersea tunnel before?

The earliest depictions of the sport go back to the 19th century.Participants in the 2025 edition wore the traditional Bavarian dress known as tracht — that's the distinctive combination of the leather pants and suspenders.Two competitors sit on opposite sides of a table and each hooks one finger — usually the middle finger — through a small leather loop.As soon as a referee signals the start, each contestant tries to pull the other across the table. The whole thing usually lasts a few seconds, and dislocated fingers are common.Officials sit behind each athlete to catch them should one of them suddenly lose his grip and fly backwards. The winner moves to the next round. By custom, only men take part.Today, fingerhakeln is highly organized and follows strict rules. In this year's championship, there were several winners in different weight and age categories.There are nine clubs in Germany and another four in neighboring Austria, says Georg Hailer, chairman of Germany's oldest and biggest club.""It's not dangerous at all,"" Hailer says. ""Of course, there will be open wounds and small injuries on the fingers from time to time.  It looks worse than it really is, because there's blood.""It's a sport that requires skill, not just strength, says one wrestler. ""There are different techniques — how do I sit at the table?"" he says. ""How do I transfer my power as quickly as possible to the loop?

After Cyprus in 2021 and Bulgaria in 2022 ended their programs, Malta was one of the last places with such a scheme.Russia's invasion of Ukraine drew attention to the policies, which some say allow Russians linked to the conflict to avoid sanctions by buying EU citizenship.The court ruling comes shortly after US President Donald Trump said he plans to start a ""gold card"" visa program that includes a potential route to US citizenship for $5 million.","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on the EU ordering Malta to end its golden passports?2.How do you think people in your country would react if your government launched a similar program?3.Do you think people should be allowed to buy citizenship in another country?4.What do you make of Donald Trump's plan to sell US citizenship for $5 million?5.If you could become a citizen of any country, which would you choose?","Exercise 4Further Discussion Have a discussion based on the following questions.1.Have you been to Malta?

It compared answers to a survey of British adults from December 2024 with surveys from 1937 to 1975.Some of the biggest changes in attitudes were toward education.For example, in 1937, two out of 10 people thought children should have homework.

He made the app to show which cafes and pub gardens in London are in the sun in real time.SunSeekr was made using the AI-supported platform Mapbox, along with data from OpenStreetMap. It shows users which cafes and pubs are in the sun based on where the sun is in the sky, as well as the height of the buildings around them.Since the app changes in real time, when shade covers one place, users can quickly check to see if there's anywhere nearby that's still in the sun. This is also useful for anyone who wants to get out of the sun, because the app tells you which cafes are in the shade too!Users can change the time and date to see which cafes and pubs will probably be in the sun later or the next day too.Anyone can use the SunSeekr map through its website.

At present, just two in five new homes in England have solar panels.According to government plans, rooftop solar panels would have to cover 40% of the area covered by a new building. Around 80% of new homes would need to follow this rule, while 19% could have fewer solar panels because of the shape of the roof, or for other reasons such as the location of the building.Just 1% of new homes are likely to have no solar panels.The new rule will probably add between around $4,400 and $5,300 to the cost of building a new home. But since an average three-bedroom home with solar panels can save about $1,300 a year on energy bills, people could make back their money in around four years.The government also plans to give grants and loans to people who want to add solar panels to older homes. However, it is much cheaper to add solar panels when building a house than to add them to an older building.The new rules are part of the British government's plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.Solar panels also make energy cheaper. In February, a report by the Resolution Foundation think tank found that people living in the poorest homes have the most to gain from solar panels, because their energy bills would be cut by 24%.Lily-Rose Ellis of Greenpeace UK said the government's plans were ""common sense,"" saying, ""For too long we've wasted the free energy that falls on the roofs of houses every single day.""","Exercise 3QuestionsAnswer the following questions about the article.1.How many new homes in England currently have solar panels?2.What percentage of new homes are likely to have no solar panels according to government plans?3.How much money can an average three-bedroom home with solar panels save on energy bills?","Exercise 4DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on the British government's plans for solar panels?2.Has your country introduced any similar laws in recent years?

It is seen as cleaner than fossil fuel energy, since it doesn't emit greenhouse gases. On the other hand, it's also associated with devastating disasters and dangerous weapons.In 1985, Denmark banned the production of nuclear power following pressure from anti-nuclear activists. However, the European country is now considering ending that 40-year ban.Denmark's Minister for Climate, Energy and Utilities Lars Aagaard has announced that the government will analyze the potential benefits of new nuclear technology. A report of its findings is expected to be ready to share in 2026.Currently, more than 80% of Denmark's power comes from renewable sources like wind, biofuels and solar power. The country has also committed to ending all fossil fuel power production by 2050.While Denmark has no plans to build large, traditional nuclear power plants, it is looking at the possible benefits of smaller, modern, modular nuclear reactors.Aagaard said the government needs to know if the new technology is really safe. It also needs to know how it should dispose of nuclear waste, and if the country's authorities are prepared if something goes wrong.""We all know that of course we can't have an electricity system based on solar and wind alone.  There has to be something else to support it,"" Aagaard said. He also explained to newspaper Politiken that the government needs to look at how using these newer nuclear technologies would affect Danish society.If Denmark does decide to lift the ban, it will be joining a number of other European countries already producing and using nuclear power.France gets around 70% of its energy from nuclear power, and connected a new reactor to its energy grid just last year. And Denmark's close neighbor, Sweden, gets 40% of its electricity from nuclear power.In fact, 44% of countries in the European Union (EU) produce nuclear power, as do non-EU countries like the UK, Switzerland and Ukraine.","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on Denmark considering lifting its nuclear ban?2.Do you think most people in your country trust nuclear power?3.If a nuclear power plant were built near your home, would you move elsewhere?4.Which energy source is better in your opinion: coal or nuclear power?

Charlie found clothing labels and certain materials uncomfortable and difficult to wear, John explained to the BBC. This made it very difficult for the family to buy him coats.So John asked his son what he would want from a coat.Charlie said it should be soft inside, and shouldn't have labels. He also wanted a hood that was big enough to go over his ear defenders, which are ear covers that protect the wearer from loud noises.He also wanted large zippers because he found small ones difficult to use, and ""fidget"" toys in the pockets. Fidget toys are small items that people can play with to help them regulate how they're feeling, or to concentrate. They can be helpful for both children and adults.When John shared his idea with his wife, Amanda, she says she thought it was a joke at first. She told the BBC, ""I just started laughing because I was like, 'Are you being serious?'""But John told her, ""I can do this,"" and he soon sent the coat design to different companies to get it made.Now — two-and-a-half years later — not only does Charlie have a coat he can wear, the Rudds are selling them online using the brand name Chammo.The coats are in sizes for 6- to 13-year olds. Just as Charlie asked, they're soft with large hoods.

It might seem like nothing, but in the UK, it could now be seen as discrimination — at least in some cases.Robert Watson recently won a case after his project leader often sighed to show frustration toward him at work.Watson began working as a software engineer at a company in August 2020. According to court reports, his time management wasn't great and he found it difficult to focus.These issues didn't make sense until late 2022, when Watson was diagnosed with ADHD. This condition can make it difficult to concentrate and stay organized.After learning about his condition, he started taking medication and took a few days off work to get used to it.When he returned to work, Watson's project leader — called ""DT"" by the court — told him he now had several extra days' worth of work to catch up on, partly due to his time off.Over the next few weeks, Watson said, DT continued to criticize him for his work habits, including his work hours, his time management, how much time he spent at his project desk, and his overall work pattern — all of which were affected by his ADHD.Watson said DT sighed or made loud breathing sounds around him, which made him feel uncomfortable and stressed.Watson took sick leave because of the stress in February 2023 and never returned. He then filed a claim for disability discrimination in May 2023.The court found that DT's behavior was linked to Watson's ADHD and was considered discrimination.

About 300 people left their homes and businesses.The landslide has brought renewed attention to the role of global warming in glacier collapses around the world.How glaciers collapse — from the Alps and Andes to the Himalayas and Antarctica — can differ, scientists say. But in almost every instance, climate change is playing a role.In Switzerland, the rock face above the glacier had become unstable when mountain permafrost melted, experts said. This caused debris to fall and cover the glacier.The debris did help to insulate the glacier and slow down its melting. However, its weight caused the ice to begin moving, threatening the village below.Lonnie Thompson, a glacier expert at the Ohio State University, said that unstable glaciers are ""a real and growing problem, and there are thousands and thousands of people that are at risk.""Scientists say melting glaciers will raise sea levels for decades, but the loss of inland glaciers also affects those living nearby who rely on them for water.And there is no way to stop the melting. Greenhouse gases from the burning of fossil fuels have already locked in enough global warming to destroy many of the world's glaciers, scientists say.Glaciers in the Alps have lost 50% of their area since 1950, and the rate at which ice is being lost has been getting faster. All of the glaciers in the Alps could disappear within a century, Thompson said.Switzerland, which has the most glaciers of any country in Europe, saw 4% of its total glacier volume disappear in 2023.The Swiss government has promised to support the people who lost their homes in the landslide.","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on the glacier collapse in Switzerland?2.Do you find it shocking that all Alpine glaciers could disappear within a century?3.Have you ever seen a glacier in person?4.What do you imagine the world would be like if all its glaciers disappeared?5.Have you been to Switzerland?

They will still be able to sell reusable vapes.This comes after reports of increasing use of vapes in schools and growing piles of discarded vapes in landfill sites.It is estimated that as many as 5 million disposable vapes are thrown in bins or littered every week across the UK, rather than being recycled.A number of countries are seeking to regulate the vape market, which has grown hugely over the past decade or so.Australia banned the sale of vapes outside pharmacies last year, while Belgium became the first European country to ban the use of disposable vapes at the start of this year.The UK government said usage among young people remained too high.Also known as single-use vapes, disposable vapes cannot be refilled or recharged, and are usually thrown away with general waste or sometimes just thrown on the street.Even when they are recycled, they need to be taken apart by hand, while their batteries are a fire risk to recycling facilities and can leak harmful chemicals into the environment.Businesses in the UK were given six months to prepare for the change by selling any existing stock. Those who continue to sell them risk a fine of $260 in the first instance, followed by an unlimited fine or jail time for repeat offending.The UK Vaping Industry Association said its members had moved quickly to comply with the June 1 deadline.However, the association said that vapes had been useful in helping people to quit smoking, and said it was concerned that the ban would encourage former smokers to return to cigarettes.","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on the UK banning the sale of disposable vapes?2.Would you support a similar ban in your country? 3.Is vaping popular in your country?

This rose from around $16 billion in 1990 to nearly $240 billion in 2025.As it is built on rising rents and property prices, The Equality Trust says property wealth comes at the expense of renters, small businesses and aspiring home buyers. The charity further says property wealth creates a disincentive among the powerful to take action on the housing crisis, since high property prices benefit those who already own it.Speaking to The Guardian, the charity's Priya Sahni-Nicholas went so far as to call extreme wealth ""vampiric,"" adding that such wealth is ""completely incompatible"" with the nation's health and well-being.Fernanda Balata of the New Economics Foundation, a British think tank, has argued that better policies are needed to address extreme wealth. Speaking to The Guardian, she said: ""We need an Extreme Wealth Line: the point at which excessive wealth causes unjustifiable harm.""However, others argue that most billionaires are already very generous in giving to charities, and are in a better position than public officials to help the poor.Bill Gates, one of the world's richest men, recently promised to give away 99% of his fortune — an estimated $107 billion — to charity by 2045.

They include an example of how AI might be used to prepare a letter to parents about a health issue at school.The DfE says AI could also be used for some marking, like for quizzes or homework — though it also says teachers must check the results, and they must be transparent about how they're using AI.Schools have also been asked to clearly outline situations where teachers and students are allowed to use AI, while students should be taught how to spot fake content and misinformation.Bridget Phillipson, the secretary of state for education, said the goal was to ""cut workloads"" so teachers can focus on providing ""inspiring teaching and personalized support.""All around the world, schools have been trying to decide what to do about AI, as students have quickly begun to use it to plan their studies, get answers to questions, and do their homework for them. Some  even use it to make fake videos to trick their teachers or bully other students.Emma Darcy, who helps schools learn to use new technology, told the BBC that teachers have a ""responsibility"" to learn how to use AI — because their students are already using it. She said teachers should know how to use AI so they can help young people use it properly.By November 2023, 42% of school teachers in the UK said they had already used AI for their work — while 74% of 16-to-24-year-olds said they had used it.","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on England allowing teachers to use AI for some tasks?2.Do you agree that teachers have a responsibility to learn how to use AI?3.Has your country introduced any laws or guidelines on the use of AI in schools? 4.Do you imagine the majority of students in your country are already using AI for their schoolwork? 5.Do you think AI could ever fully replace teachers?","Exercise 4Further Discussion Have a discussion based on the following questions.1.How do you think AI might change the schooling system in your country over the next few decades?2.Do you often use AI at work?

Many also have mange, a disease that can cause different types of problems.Sadly, the foxes don't always survive, but about half do. Cubs are put in packs of five until they are old enough and are then released in a non-urban environment while the adults are released in the neighborhoods where they were found.There are thought to be about 15,000 foxes in London.

She came up with a chocolate bar full of pistachio cream, a sesame paste called tahini, and a crispy Middle Eastern dessert known as knafeh. This bar became known as Dubai chocolate, and has since gone viral.It's gone so viral, in fact, that the UK Food Standards Agency (FSA) has issued a warning about where people buy the popular chocolate, saying it could be a danger to people with food allergies.According to UK law, food labels must list all ingredients in a product, and highlight 14 common allergens, including things like gluten, nuts, dairy and shellfish. This applies to imported products too.However, the FSA says products imported through unofficial channels may not meet these labeling rules.And when a food goes viral, there's a good chance it will quickly become available to buy on social media platforms like TikTok Shop, which lets creators and businesses sell products directly to their fans. A quick search will find a lot of results for buying Dubai chocolate through the shop.The FSA says food sold online in the UK must show allergy information at least twice during the ordering process. This would usually mean having the allergy information in the online listing, as well as on the product label when it arrives.However, a recent BBC investigation found that a number of food items for sale to British users through TikTok Shop did not have any allergy information at all. TikTok removed those items from the platform, but allergy charities say more should be done to keep people safe.","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.Do you have any food allergies?

She said it was ""increasingly important"" for Hungarians to push back against the government's policies.The massive size of the march, which the government for months had insisted would no longer be permitted in Hungary, was seen as a major blow to Orbán. The European Union's longest-serving leader has seen his popularity slump in the polls where a new opposition force has taken the lead.Orbán and his party have insisted that Pride, a celebration of LGBTQ+ visibility and struggle for equal rights, was a violation of children's rights to moral and spiritual development. A recent constitutional amendment declared that these rights should take precedence over other fundamental protections including the right to peacefully gather or protest.The law, which was fast-tracked through parliament in March, made it an offense to hold or attend events that ""depict or promote"" homosexuality to minors under the age of 18. Orbán earlier made clear that Budapest Pride was the principal target of the law.Authorities installed additional cameras throughout the city center before the march, and were expected to use facial recognition tools to identify individuals who attend the banned event.

With just a few clicks, anyone can create a photo, video or voice clip using AI.Some of these are so realistic that it's almost impossible to tell they were made by a computer. These are called deepfakes — images, videos or sounds that use AI to copy a real person's face, voice or body. Unlike regular AI images, deepfakes use real people's identities to create fake content.While some deepfakes are made for fun — for example, putting a celebrity's face in a funny video — others can be used to trick people. For example, a deepfake might show a politician saying something they never actually said, or show someone doing something wrong that they never actually did.To stop this misuse, Denmark is planning to change its copyright law to make sure people have the legal right to their own face, voice and body.Denmark's culture minister, Jakob Engel-Schmidt, said everyone has the right to control how they look and sound.""Human beings can be run through the digital copy machine and be misused for all sorts of purposes and I'm not willing to accept that,"" he told The Guardian.If the law passes, people in Denmark will be able to ask websites to delete any deepfake content that shows them without their permission.

The official added the US was ""pausing and reviewing"" its aid to ""ensure that it is contributing to a solution.""The order will remain in effect until Trump feels that Ukraine has demonstrated a commitment to peace negotiations with Russia, the official said.The halting of military aid comes some five years after Trump held up congressionally authorized assistance to Ukraine as he sought to pressure Zelenskyy to launch an investigation into Joe Biden, then a Democratic presidential candidate. The moment led to Trump's first impeachment.Before he was reelected in 2024, Trump promised a quick end to the war in Ukraine. He has shown increasing frustration with Zelenskyy while expressing confidence that Russian President Vladimir Putin can be trusted to keep the peace if a truce is reached.Earlier on March 3, Trump also criticized Zelenskyy for suggesting that the end of the war likely ""is still very, very far away.""  Zelenskyy had suggested that it would take time to come to an agreement to end the war as he tried to offer a positive view of the US-Ukraine relationship in the aftermath of last week's White House meeting.Democratic Representative Brendan Boyle criticized Trump for his decision to pause assistance to Ukraine, noting that the aid had been congressionally approved by both Democrats and Republicans.Boyle accused Trump of ""playing political games with critical military assistance.""","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on Donald Trump pausing military aid to Ukraine?2.Do you think this move will pressure Ukraine to enter peace negotiations?3.What do you make of the claim that the end of the war is likely ""very far away""?4.Do you think Russia can be trusted to keep the peace if a truce is reached?5.How closely have you been following the conflict since the 2022 invasion?","Exercise 4Further Discussion Have a discussion based on the following questions.1.Where do you get reliable information on conflicts around the world?2.Are there any wars or conflicts you think don't get enough media attention?3.Are there any past or current conflicts you'd like to learn more about?4.Do you think your country should be more involved in resolving global conflicts?5.All war is a symptom of man's failure as a thinking animal. — John Steinbeck.

According to the United Nations (UN), Mexican children eat more junk food than any others in Latin America, and many children get as much as 40% of their daily calories from unhealthy snacks.In fact, the UN warns that childhood obesity in Mexico is now an emergency.Local governments have tried to limit the amount of junk food sold at schools in the past. But a survey from 2023 to 2024 found that almost all schools in Mexico still sold junk food, while 95% offered sugary drinks and 79% sold soft drinks.So from April 2025, all schools in Mexico will no longer be allowed to sell any snack that has a warning label that indicates it has high amounts of salt, sugar or fat.This means schools will no longer be able to sell snacks that have been popular with Mexican schoolchildren for generations, such as sugary fruit drinks, chips, pork rinds, and salty peanuts with chili.School administrators that don't follow these rules could be fined between $545 and $5,450. If they break the rules again, the fine could double, which for some is almost a year's salary.Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum says schools must provide better options for students, such as water fountains or healthier snacks.However, most schools in Mexico still don't have free drinking water, with water fountains available in only 4% of schools.Another challenge is stopping junk food sales outside schools. Many sellers set up stands near school gates, selling the same unhealthy snacks to students. A recent survey found that 77% of schools had such junk food stands nearby, making it harder to control what kids eat.","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on Mexico banning junk food in schools?2.Are you surprised that one-third of kids in Mexico are overweight or obese?3.Is childhood obesity a big problem in your country?4.What were your lunches like when you were in school? 5.What are some of the most popular snacks among children where you live?","Exercise 4Further Discussion Have a discussion based on the following questions.1.Would you describe the typical diet in your country as healthy?2.Are there any foods or drinks you try to avoid? 3.What are some unhealthy foods you'd have a hard time giving up? 4.What are your favorite sugary or soft drinks?

An outbreak that began in early 2022 has become the largest in US history, affecting more than 100 million egg-laying hens.To cope with rising egg prices, some Americans have been going straight to the source — and renting hens.Rent The Chicken in New Hampshire is letting people rent egg-laying hens for six months at a time.

""You just let them out and walk around and they go in at night on their own,"" he told CBS News.""People really enjoy it,"" he added.Rent The Chicken says two hens should produce eight to 14 eggs per week.That comes to about $25 for every dozen eggs — so it's not really a savings.You can also get four hens for $735, which would reduce your cost to about $15 per dozen eggs.However, if you'd like to keep your chickens and coop at the end of your rental period, you can — for an extra $350 to $450.According to the University of Wisconsin-Madison, hens will usually live for six to eight years, and produce eggs for three to four of those years.So that might bring your price down over time.","Exercise 3QuestionsAnswer the following questions about the article.1.How much does it cost to rent two egg-laying hens from Rent The Chicken?2.How many eggs can two hens produce per week?3.How long do hens usually live?","Exercise 4DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on Rent The Chicken?2.Would you consider keeping chickens if you had the space for them?3.How much does a dozen eggs cost where you live?

Almost half of the participants (47%) said they find it difficult to focus at work just before a vacation.Losing focus at work doesn't mean someone is lazy — they might just really need a break!

Daydreaming about escaping was chosen by 45%, while getting annoyed with others was chosen by 44%.Also, 39% named feeling tired — even after getting enough sleep — as how they know it's time for a vacation. Thirty-five percent identified having low energy even on weekends as their sign.There's nothing like taking time off to help with burnout. But while we wait for our vacation, there are other things we can do to feel better and stay focused.The Mayo Clinic's advice is to find relaxing activities like yoga to do outside of work so you get a break from stress.

Many are still in perfect condition, but up to 70% end up as waste in the desert every year.Chile doesn't allow textiles in landfills, so these clothes are either left in piles on the sand, or they're burned, polluting the air.But Bastián Barria, a 32-year-old civil engineer from Chile, decided to do something about it. He co-created an organization called Desierto Vestido, which means ""Dressed Desert"" in Spanish.

They live by hunting and gathering, and avoid all contact with the outside world.It's believed they have lived in isolation for nearly 60,000 years.

He left a coconut and a can of soda on the beach, took a video, and left about five minutes later.The man is believed to run a YouTube channel with videos from dangerous locations like Afghanistan.Survival International, a group that supports Indigenous tribes, called the man's actions ""reckless and idiotic,"" and said the man put not only his own life in danger, but the lives of the people in the tribe as well.""The Sentinelese have made their wish to avoid outsiders incredibly clear over the years,"" Survival International's Caroline Pearce said.In 2018, an American man was killed by the tribe after trying to visit the island to teach Christianity.Jonathan Mazower, also from Survival International, told the BBC that social media is becoming a danger for these uncontacted tribes, with more influencers breaking the law just to gain followers.","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on this incident?2.What punishment do you think the man should get for visiting the island?3.Do you find it surprising that the Sentinelese people have managed to live in isolation for nearly 60,000 years?4.If you had a chance to talk to a member of the tribe, what would you ask them?5.What are some of the most isolated places you've been to?","Exercise 4Further Discussion Have a discussion based on the following questions.1.Could you see yourself working as an influencer or content creator?2.Have you heard of any other cases of influencers doing stupid things?3.Do you follow any travel influencers?

The auctioneers described his book as ""one of the most detailed accounts of the events of the evening.""However, Gracie did not fully recover from the hypothermia he suffered in the cold waters of the Atlantic, and died of complications from diabetes in late 1912, before he could finish editing the final version of his book.Although the letter was sold for a lot of money, it's a long way from the record sale of an item related to the Titanic.In 2024, the same auctioneers sold a gold pocket watch for $2 million.

But his similarities to Trump may have cost him and his party.The Liberals won 169 seats in Parliament — more than the Conservatives' 144, but fewer than the 172 needed for a majority, meaning they will need to rely on a smaller party to remain in power.Carney's predecessor, Justin Trudeau, had relied on the New Democrats to stay in power. But the New Democrats fared poorly, and its leader, Jagmeet Singh, said he was stepping down after eight years in charge.In his victory speech, Carney stressed the importance of unity in the face of Washington's threats.""We are over the shock of the American betrayal, but we should never forget the lessons,"" he said.""As I've been warning for months, America wants our land, our resources, our water, our country,"" Carney added. ""These are not idle threats.  President Trump is trying to break us so America can own us.""Trump has deeply angered Canadians, leading many to cancel US vacations, refuse to buy American goods and possibly even vote early. A record 7.3 million Canadians voted before election day.More than 75% of Canada's exports go to the US, so Trump's tariffs and his desire to get North American carmakers to move Canada's production south could severely damage the Canadian economy.","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on Mark Carney winning the Canadian Election? 2.Did you know much Canadian politics before reading the article? 3.How do you expect relations between Canada and the US to develop over the next few months?4.When was your country's last election?

That's about two a day — every day — for over 50 years. And he's not planning to stop anytime soon.He even holds the Guinness World Record for the most Big Mac burgers eaten.Gorske's love for Big Macs began on May 17, 1972. Since then, he's saved every single receipt and burger box. At first, he stored them in his attic, but that filled up long ago, and now he stores his empty boxes in his basement.Even though he eats fast food daily, Gorske says his cholesterol and blood sugar levels have always been normal. He credits his high metabolism and good health for being able to eat burgers daily for so long.In fact, Big Macs are so special to Gorske that he even has his own booth at his local McDonald's. It has his name on it and a picture of him on the wall. It's also where he asked his wife to marry him, back when that part of the restaurant was just a parking lot.As for challengers for his world record, Gorske isn't worried.""The advice I'd give someone who would like to challenge my record title is, 'Don't,'"" he told Guinness World Records.

But what's probably the same for most of us is that we rarely save as much as we would like.In fact, 67% of Americans say they feel like they're behind on their savings goals. That's according to a survey of 2,000 Americans done by Talker Research between March 28 and April 2, 2025.What's more, almost half of Americans say they've given up on reaching their financial goals.The survey found that the average American tries to save about $500 a month.Sixty-three percent of Americans with savings accounts also said they had already taken money out of their savings account this year. The most common reason was to pay for unexpected expenses, though many also had to take out money for everyday necessities and housing payments.Only 18% of Americans said they used their savings for something they had actually been saving for. And one-quarter said they now have less money in their savings account than they did at the start of the year.People in Generation X — usually defined as those born between 1965 and 1980 — have been hit hardest, with 31% saying their savings have decreased.That compares to the 19% of millennials who saw their savings decrease. Millennials are usually those born between 1981 and 1996.But 38% of young people in Generation Z — usually defined as those born between 1997 and 2012 — actually saw their savings increase, more than any other age group.It may not be surprising to hear that Americans are struggling to save. An October 2024 report from the Bank of America Institute found that over one-quarter of Americans have to spend more than 95% of their income on necessities.","Exercise 3QuestionsAnswer the following questions about the article.1.How much does the average American try to save each month, according to the survey?2.What word is used to describe people born between 1981 and 1996?3.What percentage of Gen Zers saw their savings increase?","Exercise 4DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.Do you find it surprising that so many Americans have given up on their financial goals?2.Do you have a monthly savings goal?3.Are you saving up for anything in particular at the moment?4.When was the last time you used your savings for something you had actually saved up for?5.Are you better at saving now than when you were younger?"

The prison was closed in 1963 due to crumbling infrastructure and the high costs of repairing and supplying the island facility, because everything from fuel to food had to be brought by boat.Bringing the facility up to modern-day standards would require massive investments at a time when the Bureau of Prisons has been closing prisons for similar infrastructure issues.The Bureau of Prisons has also been facing a number of crises in recent years. Reporting by The Associated Press found widespread criminal activity by employees, dozens of escapes, chronic violence, deaths and severe staffing shortages that have limited responses to emergencies.At the same time, the Bureau of Prisons is operating in a state of flux — with a recently installed new director and a redefined mission that includes taking in thousands of immigration detainees at some of its prisons and jails under an agreement with the Department of Homeland Security.Alcatraz — infamously inescapable due to the strong ocean currents and cold Pacific waters that surround it — was known as the ""The Rock,"" and housed some of the nation's most notorious criminals, including gangster Al Capone.But Alcatraz Island is now a major tourist site that's operated by the National Park Service as a National Historic Landmark.Trump's order comes as the president has been clashing with the courts as he tries to send accused gang members to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador, without due process.Trump has also directed the opening of a detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to hold up to 30,000 of what he has labeled the ""worst criminal aliens.""","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on Donald Trump ordering the reopening of Alcatraz?2.Do you think it's realistic for Alcatraz to reopen as a prison anytime soon?3.Have you been to San Francisco?

The new head of the Catholic Church has been announced as Robert Prevost, who will go by Pope Leo XIV.  The 69-year-old is the first American pope.   He has overcome a taboo against having a pope from the US, with the country seen as already having a lot of international political power. Prevost is originally from Chicago, but is also a Peruvian citizen and lived in Peru for many years, first as a missionary and then as an archbishop.He has twice been elected leader of the Augustinians, a religious order founded by St. Augustine in the 13th Century.  His predecessor, Pope Francis moved him from that job and back to Peru in 2014 to be the administrator and later archbishop of the city of Chiclayo.He remained in that position, acquiring Peruvian citizenship in 2015, until Francis brought him to Rome in 2023.  There he became president of the Pontifical Commission for Latin America — the part of the world with more Catholics than any other. Prevost presided over one of the biggest reforms Francis made to the church, when he added the first three women ever to the voting bloc that decides which bishop nominations to send on to the pope.  In early 2025, Francis made Prevost a cardinal, the most senior role in the Catholic church after pope. The conclave, recently the subject of a Hollywood film starring Ralph Fiennes, is a centuries-old ritual.  During it, cardinals are cut off from the outside world to vote.If no pope is chosen at the end of a day of voting, black smoke is sent up from a Vatican chimney.

Metastasized cancer is much more difficult to treat than localized cancer because it can be hard for drugs to reach all the tumors and completely remove the disease.However, when prostate cancers need hormones to grow, as in Biden's case, they can respond to treatment that deprives the tumors of hormones.Outcomes have improved in recent decades and patients can expect to live with metastatic prostate cancer for four or five years, said Dr. Matthew Smith of Massachusetts General Brigham Cancer Center.""It's very treatable, but not curable,"" Smith said. ""Most men in this situation would be treated with drugs and would not be advised to have either surgery or radiation therapy.""Many political leaders sent Biden their wishes for his recovery.President Donald Trump, a longtime political opponent, posted on social media that he was saddened by the news and said: ""we wish Joe a fast and successful recovery.""Biden's vice president, Kamala Harris, said on social media that she was keeping him in her family's ""hearts and prayers during this time.""She wrote: ""Joe is a fighter — and I know he will face this challenge with the same strength, resilience, and optimism that have always defined his life and leadership.""","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on Joe Biden being diagnosed with prostate cancer?2.Have any politicians in your country ever had to step down or take a break due to health problems?3.What do you imagine are the major causes of cancer cases where you live?4.Do you think a cure for cancer will be discovered within your lifetime?5.How would you rate your country's healthcare system?","Exercise 4Further Discussion Have a discussion based on the following questions.1.What do you imagine are the most common health issues in your country?2.Would you say you've become more health conscious over the years?3.Is it common for people in your country to have private health insurance?4.What medical advancements do you hope to see within your lifetime?5.Health is not valued till sickness comes. — Thomas Fuller.

But it does need places for people to live.In fact, real estate company Realogic said that in January 2022, 192 US malls had plans to add housing to their sites.These changes have a number of advantages. The malls can use more of their space, and the new apartments mean people live right by the restaurants and stores, which they're now more likely to use.Some of the country's many malls have found it hard to make money with more competition from online stores.However, Jacob Knudsen, from the real estate company Macerich, told CNBC that he believes ""the mall is becoming cool again.""Knudsen's company is adding housing to the FlatIron Crossing Mall in Colorado. As well as housing, some malls are building things like pickleball courts and medical centers. So these large spaces are no longer just places to go shopping.Of course, not everyone would like the idea of living in a mall, and some people are worried that apartments will increase traffic congestion in these areas.But CNN reports that mall apartments are popular among young people and single adults, who can have everything in one place, along with a ready-made community.","Exercise 3QuestionsAnswer the following questions about the article.1.How many US malls had plans to add housing in January 2022?2.What are some of the advantages of adding housing to malls?3.Why have some US malls found it hard to make money recently?","Exercise 4DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on malls adding apartments to their sites?2.Could you see yourself living in a mall?3.Do you think mall apartments could be popular in your country?4.Is there a housing shortage in your town or city?5.Do you live walking-distance to restaurants and shops?"

It also accused Harvard of working with the Chinese Communist Party, saying it hosted and trained members of a Chinese paramilitary group as recently as 2024.The Trump administration's quarrel with Harvard, the nation's oldest and wealthiest university, has intensified since it became the first to openly oppose White House demands for changes at elite schools it has criticized as breeding grounds of liberal ideas and antisemitism. The federal government has also cut $2.6 billion in federal grants to Harvard, forcing it to self-fund much of its research operation. President Donald Trump has said he wants to strip the university of its tax-exempt status.Harvard President Alan Garber earlier this month said the university has made changes to its organization over the past year and a half, including a broad strategy to deal with antisemitism, but warned it would not move on its ""legally-protected principles.""  He said he wasn't aware of evidence to support the administration's allegation that its international students were ""more prone to disruption, violence"" or other bad behavior than any other students.Harvard filed a lawsuit on May 23 in a federal court in Boston, saying the government's action breaks legal rights to free speech.The lawsuit is separate from the university's earlier one challenging more than $2 billion in federal cuts imposed by Trump's administration.Harvard enrolls almost 6,800 foreign students at its campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

You might recognize the image — it's one of the more famous pictures to come out of the US.But the man in that image isn't a politician or a celebrity — he's a character known as Uncle Sam.He's arguably one of the most commonly referenced characters in America. And over time, Uncle Sam has become a symbol — and personification — of the country and its government.The term is sometimes used as a synonym for the country. Take this headline from The Economist, for example: ""How Cuba competes with Uncle Sam in the Caribbean islands.""But where did Uncle Sam come from?It's thought that the name was first used in 1813. The name Sam came from Samuel Wilson, a man who supplied barrels of beef to the US army.He stamped ""US"" on the barrels, and some soldiers began referring to the barrels as ""Uncle Sam's"" because of those initials.In time, according to Sky History, this slang was reported by newspapers, and by the second half of the 19th century it was being used as a nickname for the nation.Magazines and newspapers of the time began drawing their own visions of the character, although it was cartoonist Thomas Nast who helped popularize the most famous version of the image.Nast, who is also credited with popularizing the modern image of Santa Claus, drew Uncle Sam as a thin man with long hair, a high hat, striped pants and a beard — someone designed to look dignified and moral.But the famous characterization that made it onto that poster was drawn years later by James Montgomery Flagg. It was used to recruit men to the US army during World War I.

And part of that is having enough money to live well, which a good savings plan can help with.However, a survey has found that four in 10 Americans don't have a retirement savings plan.The survey was done by research company Gallup. It asked around 1,000 adults living across the US about their retirement plans. And around six in 10 said they have money invested in either a retirement savings plan or a retirement account, either alone or with a spouse.It's probably not a surprise that older Americans are more likely to have a retirement plan — 70% of survey participants aged 50 to 64 said they have one, and 63% of 30-to-49-year-olds do. Only 39% of participants aged 18 to 29 said they do.Income makes a difference too, with 83% of participants in households making at least $100,000 per year having a retirement savings plan. Fewer than one-third of those from households making less than $50,000 a year said they are saving for retirement.Also, 81% of participants who graduated university have retirement savings, while only 39% of those without a university education do.However, people with a retirement savings plan are only a bit more confident about their future compared with those not saving. Just half of those with a retirement savings plan expect they'll be able to live comfortably when they retire, but 31% of people with no savings plan think they will.The good news for both groups is that most people who are already retired feel they have enough money to live well.

Social media is also ahead of news websites and apps, which 48% of Americans said they get their news from.The report also seems to confirm the rise of the ""news influencer,"" as audiences choose social media personalities over traditional journalists and reporters. For example, almost one fifth of those surveyed said they had come across podcaster and comedian Joe Rogan talking about the news in the previous week.Another 14% said they had seen news and commentary by Tucker Carlson, and the same number named Megyn Kelly — both of whom used to work in television news before moving to social media platforms.The research also noted that some politicians have been bypassing mainstream media to give interviews to online influencers, with populist politicians increasingly choosing to sit with social media personalities who are more likely to agree with them, and less likely to ask difficult questions.The US isn't alone in this trend. The report also said social media news influencers are finding large audiences in India, Brazil, Indonesia and Thailand.

The goal is to have 500 to 1,000 operating in smaller cities and around 2,000 in larger cities.Although Zoox will be putting its robotaxis together in the US, about half of the parts come from outside the country, the company said.Zoox CEO Aicha Evans said it was ""an exciting time"" for the company.While Zoox wants to challenge Waymo, it certainly isn't copying it.

This makes it easier for researchers to compare the effectiveness of areas with different plastic bag policies.A research team from New York's Columbia University looked at over 180 of these local policies.  These included fees for plastic bags, complete bans, and also partial bans — where thinner single-use bags are banned but thicker bags that can be reused are allowed.They then looked at data from over 45,000 shoreline cleanups between 2017 and 2023 that included records of the percentage of plastic bags collected among other litter. This data enabled them to compare the proportion of plastic bags collected before and after a local policy was passed, and also to see the differences between areas that had plastic bag policies and those that did not.The researchers found that areas that have policies against the use of plastic bags saw a 25% to 47% decrease in the proportion of plastic bags in shoreline cleanups.They even found that fees for plastic bags were actually more effective than complete bans — although they weren't sure why.However, the researchers did not look at the actual number of plastic bags being found — only their proportion compared to other litter.Plastic bags, because they are light, are caught very easily by the wind, which makes it easy for them to get into rivers, and from there they find their way into the sea.Washed up on shorelines they can have a negative effect on tourism.

For college graduates aged 22 to 27 years old, the unemployment rate was 5.8% in March — the highest, excluding the pandemic, since 2012, and above the nationwide rate.The rise in unemployment has economists concerned because it could be an early sign of trouble for the economy. It suggests businesses are hesitating to hire new workers because of uncertainty stemming from the Trump administration's tariff increases, which could slow growth.The growth of AI may also be contributing by eating away at beginner positions in professions like IT, finance and law. Matthew Martin, senior US economist at Oxford Economics, has calculated that employment for college graduates aged 22 to 27 in computer science and mathematics occupations has fallen 8% since 2022.Still, many economists argue that blaming AI is premature. Most companies are in the early stages of adopting the technology.The overall US unemployment rate is a still-low 4.2%, and government reports show the economy is generating modest job gains. But the additional jobs are concentrated in health care, government, and restaurants and hotels. Job gains in professions with more college graduates, such as IT, law and accounting, have languished in the past 12 months.While unemployment remains low, the actual hiring rate — new hires as a percentage of all jobs — has fallen to 2014 levels, when the unemployment rate was much higher, at 6.2%. Economists call it a no-hire, no-fire economy.Higher unemployment for younger graduates has some concerned about the value of a college degree. As more workers have a four-year degree, it becomes less of a distinguishing factor in job applications. Murat Tasci, an economist at JPMorgan, calculates that 45% of workers have a four-year degree, up from 26% in 1992.However, most economists argue that a college degree still offers clear lifetime benefits. Graduates earn higher pay and experience much less unemployment over their lifetimes.","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on the challenges US graduates are facing?2.Are graduates in your country facing a tough job market?3.Do most people at your workplace have a college degree? 4.Did you go to college?

Being told to smile, especially when you don't feel like it, can be uncomfortable. And when it happens at work, some people even see it as harassment.A new survey found that almost half of people in Japan think asking store workers to smile is harassment. The study, done by Helpfeel, asked 1,070 people in their 20s to their 60s about customer service.One question asked participants how they felt about asking store workers to smile. Around 45% of people said they saw it as harassment, with the answers being similar across all age groups.And Japanese companies have even been making changes in their ""smile"" policies.  For example, McDonald's Japan once used the slogan, ""Smile for 0 yen.""  The idea was that customers could always expect a smile from McDonald's workers.But many young workers said they didn't feel comfortable with this idea, and past survey showed that being forced to smile was one reason some people didn't want to work at McDonald's.So in 2023, McDonald's Japan began a new campaign called ""Smile Agenai,"" or ""I won't smile for you."" It let workers choose not to smile if they didn't want to.The campaign was a success, and job applications for McDonald's increased by 115%.As a result of the campaign, McDonald's has changed its image from ""a place where smiling is mandatory"" to ""a place that accepts smiles of all shapes and sizes.""","Exercise 3QuestionsAnswer the following questions about the article.1.How many people took part in Helpfeel's survey?2.What percentage of people in Japan think asking store workers to smile is a form of harassment?3.When did McDonald's Japan start its ""Smile Agenai"" campaign?","Exercise 4DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on the findings of Helpfeel's survey?2.Do you agree that forcing store workers to smile is a form of harassment?3.How would you feel if your job required you to smile all the time?4.Is there anyone at your workplace who always seems to be smiling?5.Have you ever had a customer-facing job?

For this study, researchers used data from 1,474 Japanese sources.The study found that Japan's average life expectancy rose from 79.4 years in 1990 to 85.2 years in 2021. For women, life expectancy has risen to 88.1 years, and for men it has risen to 82.2 years.According to the study, the general increase in life expectancy has been due to a reduction in deaths from causes like strokes, heart disease and cancer. Japan's progress in treating and preventing stomach cancer in particular has done much to raise people's life expectancy.However, the study also found that there was a growing gap between life expectancy and healthy life expectancy — the number of years people can expect to live in good health. This has grown from 9.9 years in 1990 to 11.3 years in 2021.There are also big differences between life expectancies and healthy life expectancies in different prefectures of Japan. Generally, western prefectures had higher life expectancies in 2021, with Shiga, Kyoto and Nagano as the top three, while northern prefectures like Aomori and Akita had the lowest life expectancies.The study suggested that these differences between prefectures could be due to things like regional economic and educational differences, and the availability of health care resources.The study's authors also warn that as Japanese people are living longer, age-related health problems are becoming a greater challenge for health care systems.The researchers say the next great challenge Japan's health care services will have to face is dealing with increases in health problems like Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia, as well as diabetes.","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on the increase in life expectancy in Japan?2.Do you find it concerning that the gap between life expectancy and healthy life expectancy has increased?3.Would you say people in your area generally live a healthy lifestyle?4.Do you think your country is well prepared to care for an aging population?5.In your opinion, what would be the ideal human lifespan?","Exercise 4Further Discussion Have a discussion based on the following questions.1.Who are the oldest people you know?

Students play baseball, soccer, basketball and other sports to stay active, learn teamwork and spend time with friends.These club activities are an important part of Japanese school life. But by the 2060s, many of them might have to stop during the summer.A new study by Japan's National Institute for Environmental Studies and Waseda University says hotter temperatures could mean summer sports could become dangerous. The researchers studied data from 842 locations across Japan over 12 years.They looked at something called the ""wet-bulb globe temperature"" (WBGT), which includes heat, humidity, wind and sunlight. For example, higher levels of humidity can make the air feel hotter than it really is.Right now, the Japanese government has heat safety rules to protect students from heat-related illnesses. Schools should stop strenuous outdoor activities when the WBGT doesn't go under 28 degrees Celsius for at least two hours, and if it doesn't go below 31 degrees Celsius for at least two hours, all activities — indoors and outdoors — should stop.In the future, these dangerous heat levels will happen more often, and the researchers suggest around 75% of Japan could have several months when school sports need to stop.Some schools already try to have early morning practices or move activities indoors. And the biggest sporting event of the summer, the Koshien baseball tournament, now plays games in the morning or evening, takes long breaks, and gives players time to cool down.

Do you bring your own lunch from home, eat out, or maybe buy pre-made meals from a shop?Bringing your own lunch can mean healthier meals, but it takes time to prepare. Eating out can also take time — which might be a problem if you have a busy day! And store-bought lunches are fast and easy, but they're not always fresh or good for you.In Japan, a new vending machine is trying to solve this problem by selling fresh salad, ready to grab and go.These new machines are called Salad Stands. They're made by Kompeito, a company that says it wants to help busy people eat better.Over 10 years ago, Kompeito started a different service called Office de Yasai, or ""Vegetables at the Office.""  As part of that service, the company brought fresh fruit and vegetable snacks to special refrigerators installed in office kitchens and break rooms. This way, busy workers could eat something healthy without giving up convenience.Now, Kompeito is taking that idea out of the office.Salad Stand vending machines sell eight different varieties of salad, with options including grilled chicken, smoked salmon with cheese, and a seafood mix of crab and sardines.Salad Stands also sell juices, and granola made from leftover vegetable peels and leaves.But what makes this machine special isn't just the food — it's the technology inside!Salad Stands have built-in AI that checks how many people walk by, and the expiration dates on the food. If a salad is getting close to its expiration date — or if not many people are walking past — the machine automatically lowers the price.That means less food gets wasted, and you might get a good deal!","Exercise 3QuestionsAnswer the following questions about the article.1.What company makes Salad Stands?2.How many different types of salad do the vending machines offer? 3.What do Salad Stands use AI for?","Exercise 4DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on Kompeito's Salad Stands?2.Would you use Salad Stands if they were available where you live?3.What do you usually eat for lunch during the workweek?4.Are there many healthy fast food options near where you live or work?5.How often do you buy food from vending machines?"

This was the first time a private firm had successfully landed a spacecraft on the moon without crashing or falling over.Another American company, Intuitive Machines, landed a spacecraft on the moon a few days later, but it ended up falling into a crater.Now it's ispace's turn. It's targeting the first week of June for Resilience's touchdown. The company's first lander crashed into the moon in 2023. It later said the crash was caused by a software problem.According to Space News, ispace's lander has taken so much longer to get near to the moon than the American lander because it took a ""low-energy trajectory"" that meant less propulsion was needed.The ispace lander holds a mini rover that will gather lunar dirt for analysis as well as other experiments.Takeshi Hakamada, the CEO of ispace, said the company had learned lessons from the first mission and said he was very proud of the crew for successfully guiding the lander into lunar orbit.Its entry into lunar orbit came just a few days after May 4, which is celebrated as ""Star Wars day"" because the line from the movies ""May the force be with you"" sounds similar to ""May the fourth.""It is perhaps appropriate timing, as Hakamada has said that he was inspired by the Star Wars movies as a child.While this lander is still in space, Hakamada's company continues to work on other spacecraft that are due to be launched in 2026 and 2027.","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on ispace's Resilience entering lunar orbit?2.Do you expect more countries to land on the moon in the coming years? 3.How do you feel about private companies taking the lead in space exploration?4.Would you be interested in going to the moon if it became possible?5.Are there any space missions you followed closely?","Exercise 4Further Discussion Have a discussion based on the following questions.1.Do you think you'd enjoy working for a space company?2.What excites you most about space exploration? 3.In your opinion, how important is it for countries to invest in space exploration?4.Do you think space tourism will become affordable within your lifetime?5.The Earth is the cradle of humanity, but mankind cannot stay in the cradle forever.

Tokyo's listening bars are just the place to do this — relaxed places where people listen to music, usually on high-quality audio equipment.The history of listening bars in Tokyo goes back to the 1920s, when music lovers couldn't afford to buy records for themselves. Instead, they went to small cafes — or kissaten — to listen to records with other music fans. While normal bars just play music while people talk or dance, listening bars are about quietly enjoying the music.Listening bars have since opened across Japan, as well as in other countries. And now, Tokyo even has a mobile listening bar. Minibar Midori is a green 1977 Mini Clubman Estate that has been turned into a bar. But it often pulls a solar-powered trailer made by another company called Mobile SS that works as a listening room. When the two are together, they make a mobile listening bar.Midori has been seen around Tokyo since January 2025, often near Ebisu, Sakura-shimmachi and Jimbocho stations. Its owner, Shiori Tanaka, told Designboom she wants to offer a spontaneous and fun experience that people will remember — something that can be difficult in a city where everything is found on Google Maps and social media.But that's not to say that finding Minibar Midori is just about luck.

""A rose by any other name would smell as sweet,"" she added.Juliet meant that just as a rose would still smell wonderful if we gave it a different name, so with people, names are not important — it's who you are that matters.However, according to a new survey in Japan, names do matter to a lot of people. So much so, that many people decide not to get married because of a Japanese law on surnames.According to Japanese law, couples have to choose the same surname when they get married. Japan is actually the only country to have this law.Asuniwa, an organization campaigning to end this law, surveyed 1,600 men and women aged between 20 and 59. Of these, 538 were legally married, 530 were single, and 532 were in a common-law marriage — meaning they live together like a married couple, without having filed for marriage at a government office.The survey found that almost 30% of people in a common-law marriage had chosen not to marry because one of them didn't want to change their name. And for people in their 20s, the percentage was even higher at 40%.Almost 50% of people in a common-law marriage said they would get legally married if they could have different surnames. And this was true for 60% of those in their 20s.Common-law couples don't have the same legal rights as legally married couples, and this can affect things like their taxes, inheritance and decisions about a partner's medical treatment.Based on the survey results and data from the government, Asuniwa says there are probably 1.2 million people in common-law marriages in Japan, and 587,000 of them would choose to marry if they could have different surnames.","Exercise 3QuestionsAnswer the following questions about the article.1.How many people were surveyed by Asuniwa?2.What percentage of people in common-law marriages said they would get married if they could have different surnames?3.How many people in Japan are in common-law marriages?","Exercise 4DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on Asuniwa's findings?2.Do you find it surprising that Japan is the only country that requires married couples to have the same surname?3.Do you think there's any benefit to married couples having the same surname?4.Do you expect Japan to change its surname law in the near future?5.Do you know any married couples with different surnames?"

Not speaking the language? Finding somewhere to change your money? Getting lost on public transport?Well, a lack of trash cans is the most common problem for visitors to Japan, according to a survey by the Japan Tourism Agency (JTA).The JTA surveyed over 4,000 tourists who were leaving Japan between December 2024 and January 2025. Tourists at airports in Tokyo, Osaka, Fukuoka and Hokkaido were asked what problems they had had during their trip.The most common problems were a lack of trash cans, named by almost 22% of travelers, followed by difficulty communicating with staff at facilities, named by just over 15%. Crowded tourist spots were a problem for 13% of participants, and almost 9% said long waits at airport immigration were a problem.When asked where they found the lack of trash cans to be a problem, many said either at tourist spots or on their way to tourist spots. Many also said they had to take their trash back to their accommodation.According to Kyodo News, Japan used to have more trash cans in public places, but most of these have been removed because of concerns about terrorist attacks, such as the Tokyo subway sarin gas attack in 1995.When asked where they had difficulty communicating, the most common answer was restaurants. But many people were also able to get around this problem by using translation apps.The good news is that over 50% of the survey participants said they had no problems at all during their trip. And the percentage of people giving this answer has increased by over 20 points since the last survey was done in 2023.","Exercise 3QuestionsAnswer the following questions about the article.1.What percentage of respondents complained about the lack of trash cans in Japan?2.Why have many trash cans been removed from public places in Japan?3.What percentage of respondents said they had no problems during their trip?","Exercise 4DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on the JTA's findings?2.What are some of the biggest problems you've had while traveling abroad?3.Have you ever had trouble communicating with people abroad?4.What's the longest wait you've had at immigration?5.What are the most crowded tourist attractions you've visited?"

Many also said their staff weren't happy with their pay.Others left because of the company's culture, or because of problems with colleagues or bosses.Hiring new staff takes time and costs money. More than one in five companies said they spend at least 3 million won — about $2,200 — on hiring just one new member of staff.However, the survey also found that companies could do more to keep their staff. Fewer than half said they have programs to encourage people to stay with the firm — things like incentives for those who stay for a certain amount of time, and mentoring programs.And the situation could become even more difficult for companies in the years to come, with South Korea facing a labor shortage.Recent estimates suggest that by 2033, the country could be short more than 800,000 workers.But at the same time, The Korea Herald has said many businesses are choosing to hire older workers, making the market difficult for people in their 20s.According to government data from the start of 2025, the number of working people aged between 25 and 29 fell by 98,000 compared to the same period in 2024.","Exercise 3QuestionsAnswer the following questions about the article.1.What percentage of the surveyed companies had staff leave less than three years after arriving?2.How much do one in five companies spend on hiring one new member of staff? 3.How many workers could South Korea be short by 2033?","Exercise 4DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on Incruit's findings?2.Do you find it surprising that many workers in South Korea leave their jobs less than three years after starting? 3.Have you ever left a job because it wasn't the right fit?4.When was the last time someone left your team or company?5.What do you think companies could do to keep their staff from leaving?"

The scheme will last for four months and is likely to start in either June or July of this year.The city government plans to submit a budget to its assembly in June that includes 36.8 billion yen — around $258 million — to cover the costs of waiving the fees.Like many cities around the world, Tokyo's summers are getting hotter. At the same time, the cost of living across Japan is increasing. It is hoped that waiving base water fees will help people save the money they need to pay for air conditioning — so they can stay cool, comfortable and healthy this summer.Last summer, a record 263 people died of heatstroke in Tokyo, according to the Bureau of Public Health. A lot of the victims either didn't have air conditioning or didn't use it because of the cost.The Tokyo Fire Department said that in 60% of cases where people died of heatstroke indoors, the victims hadn't turned on their air conditioning, according to  The Japan Times.The Tokyo government plan doesn't mean zero water bills, however. In Japan, households pay a base fee for their water supply and then for the amount of water they actually use. The base fee depends on the size of a building's water pipes — the larger the pipe, the bigger the fee.On average, base water fees in Tokyo are between 860 yen and 1,460 yen — around $6 to $10 per month. By waiving these fees, it is thought that the scheme will save households around 5,000 yen, or around $35.","Exercise 3QuestionsAnswer the following questions about the article.1.How much money does the Tokyo government plan to set aside to cover the cost of waiving water fees?2.How many people died of heatstroke in Tokyo last summer?3.How much money is the average household expected to save through the scheme?","Exercise 4DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on Tokyo's plan to waive base water fees this summer?2.What are summers usually like where you live? 3.Do you use air conditioning a lot during the summer?4.Do you take any steps at home to save on electricity or water?5.Have you heard any useful tips for staying comfortable during a heat wave?"

In 2023, they even passed a new rule asking people not to walk on escalators at all.However, many people continued to walk, even after the rule was made.So the city introduced a group of workers called the Peaceful Stop and Stand Squad to help spread the message.These workers stand on the right side of the escalator to stop people from walking. They wear red jackets and carry large signs that look like hands, with ""Stop peacefully"" written on them.Members of the Squad work six-hour shifts four or five times a month. No special skills are needed — just the ability to stand.In 2024, they worked at 19 train stations in Nagoya. The city says more people are now standing on both sides, so the Squad will keep working this year.Research has found that standing on an escalator helps everyone move faster overall. It's also believed to be safer if everyone stays still, as it can stop people tripping or bumping into each other.But not everyone agrees with this. Some say walking isn't dangerous, and the real problem is people who run on the escalators or people who look at their phones and don't watch where they're going.","Exercise 3QuestionsAnswer the following questions about the article.1.When did Nagoya introduce a rule asking people not to walk on escalators? 2.What special skills are needed to join the Peaceful Stop and Stand Squad?3.How many stations did the Squad work at in 2024?","Exercise 4DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on Nagoya's Peaceful Stop and Stand Squad? 2.Do you find it surprising that standing on an escalator helps everyone move faster?3.Do you usually walk or stand still on escalators?4.Do people tend to stand still on escalators where you live?5.How often do you find yourself in a hurry on your commute?"

Almost 37 million people visited last year, but according to government data, the number of domestic tourists decreased.There was a drop of about 8% in the number of domestic tourists compared to 2019, although Japanese residents still took 540 million domestic trips during the year.The government has said this decrease may have been caused by the country's shrinking and aging population.But not everyone agrees. One of the reasons given for the increase in international visitors has been the weak yen, which is something that Japanese residents don't benefit from.In fact, some have said that it's gotten more expensive to travel inside Japan because hotels and other businesses have increased prices to make the most of the influx of foreign tourists.And they said that prices of goods in stores have increased, too, meaning people have less money to spend on travel.Other residents have said that with so many international visitors, many popular places have become too busy.But the government wants to encourage locals to travel in numbers again.In a town in Kagawa prefecture, tourists can spend part of their holiday working in a local bar or restaurant to make their trip less expensive.In other areas, visitors have been encouraged to work on local farms to experience life in a different part of the country. They're  often given free accommodation in exchange for their work.Some say that these programs could also be a cheap and easy way to help with the country's labor shortage.","Exercise 3QuestionsAnswer the following questions about the article.1.How many people visited Japan in 2024?2.How many domestic trips did Japanese residents take in 2024?3.What does the government say caused the decrease in domestic tourists?","Exercise 4DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on the falling number of domestic tourists in Japan?2.Did you take a trip in your country last year?3.Does the idea of working while on holiday appeal to you?4.What are some of the most affordable holiday destinations you've been to?5.Do you have any travel plans for this year?"

The survey was done in April 2025, and asked 1,100 people in Japan aged 20 to 69 about their tea-drinking habits.Sencha is a type of green tea.

Last year's figure is about one-quarter of the peak of 2.7 million births in 1949 during the postwar baby boom.The data in a country with a rapidly aging and shrinking population adds to concern about the economy and national security at a time the government seeks to increase defense spending.Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has described the situation as ""a silent emergency"" and has promised to promote a more flexible working environment and other measures that would help married couples to balance work and parenting, especially in rural areas where family values tend to be more conservative and harder on women.The Health Ministry's latest data showed that Japan's fertility rate — the average number of babies a woman is expected to have in her lifetime — also fell to a new low of 1.15 in 2024, from 1.2 a year earlier. The number of marriages was slightly up, to 485,063 couples, but the downtrend since the 1970s remains unchanged.Experts say the government measures have not addressed the growing number of young people reluctant to marry, while focusing largely on couples already married who plan to have or already have children.The younger generation are increasingly reluctant to marry or have children due to poor job prospects, a high cost of living and a gender-biased corporate culture that makes life harder for women and working mothers.Japan's population of about 124 million people is projected to fall to 87 million by 2070, when 40% of the population will be over 65.","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on Japan's rapidly falling birth rate?2.Do you think the downtrend is likely to be reversed any time soon? 3.Do you know many couples with kids?

They also decide how to read those characters. Many kanji have several possible readings, so even two people with the same written name might pronounce the characters in different ways.This can cause confusion, especially when the pronunciation is very unusual.Some parents give their children what are known as kirakira names. Kirakira means ""shiny"" or ""sparkly"" in Japanese. These names often use rare kanji or unusual readings.Some parents just choose names that are unusual no matter how they're written, including Pikachu, after the Pokemon character; Pu, after Winnie-the-Pooh; and Ojisama, the Japanese word for prince.A former Olympic athlete even named her sons Girishia (the Japanese pronunciation of Greece) and Torino (Turin), after locations where the Olympics were held.Some parents defend these unusual name choices. They say it's a way to show creativity in a society where it's often seen as best not to stand out too much.But others say these names can cause problems for children, since they may be bullied or feel embarrassed. Others worry that strange names can make life harder, especially in official settings.The kirakira name trend has grown over the years, but now the government is stepping in.A new rule says parents must tell local authorities how to pronounce the kanji in their child's name. And only standard readings will be accepted to avoid confusion.The government says that when names are hard to read, it causes confusion in places like schools, hospitals and government offices. For example, doctors might make mistakes when reading records, and government workers may struggle to fill out official documents.If a name's pronunciation is too far from the standard, parents must explain their choice in writing.

China was the biggest overseas market for Japanese seafood.The decision to lift the ban comes at a time when China and Japan are trying to improve ties as both face economic uncertainty because of the tariffs imposed by the US.The nuclear plant at Fukushima was heavily damaged by a deadly tsunami that followed a huge offshore earthquake in 2011. Water had to be pumped in to cool the radioactive fuel. This water was then stored in a large complex of tanks on the property.After years of debate, the plant got permission to discharge the water gradually into the sea after treating it to remove most of the radioactive elements and diluting it with seawater.Japanese officials said the wastewater would be safer than international standards and have almost no environmental impact.China disagreed and imposed a ban, saying the discharge would endanger the fishing industry and coastal communities on its east coast.Over months of talks, Japan agreed to let China take samples of the water for testing. The sampling has not found any issues, the customs agency notice said.China still opposes the wastewater discharge, but based on scientific evidence and analysis, it is allowing imports on a conditional basis from parts of Japan that meet China's standards.A ban remains in place for seafood from 10 of Japan's 47 prefectures, including Fukushima and nearby areas.Japanese seafood exporters will have to reapply for registration in China and all imports will have to include a health certificate, a certificate of compliance for radioactive substance testing and a certificate of origin, China said.","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on China lifting its ban on most Japanese seafood imports?2.Do you expect China to lift the ban on seafood imports from the remaining 10 prefectures any time soon? 3.What are your country's biggest exports?

As early as the fifth century BC, all free men in Athens were involved in the work of the government.So it's probably not a surprise that it's also the birthplace of the word ""democracy."" The word comes from two Ancient Greek words: demos, meaning ""people,"" and kratos, meaning ""rule.""There are a lot of words we use in English that are of Greek origin. And while Greek words are nothing to be scared of, they do help us describe our fears!That's because the word ""phobia"" comes from the Greek word phobos, which means ""fear."" If you're afraid of spiders, you have ""arachnophobia"" — arachne is the Greek word for ""spider.""Many other fears follow the same pattern. So if you're afraid of dinosaurs, you have ""deinophobia.""Deinos means ""terrible.""  And the word ""dinosaur"" also comes from Greek, because savra means ""lizard."" So ""dinosaur"" translates as ""terrible lizard.""You won't find any dinosaurs in the zoo, but there's another Greek word: ""zoo."" It comes from the word for animal — zoon.And if you visit Athens zoo, you'll be close to the town of Marathon.This is the place that gives its name to the running event, although we now also use the word ""marathon"" to describe things that go on for a long time. For example, you and your friends might have a ""movie marathon"" and watch all the Harry Potter movies one after the other!When we're talking about the running event, a marathon is 42.2 kilometers long. That's the distance from the town of Marathon to the center of Athens.

These included words like ""kill"" and ""murder,"" as well as other similar terms.But they did not include passive phrases that contained these verbs, such as, ""He was killed by that person.""They also didn't include questions, such as ""Was he murdered?"" or negations, such as, ""She was not murdered.""  And they didn't include other violent verbs like ""shoot.""This gave them quite a ""conservative estimate"" for violent language, they said.The study found that although the number of murderous verbs used was different every year, the overall trend was a clear increase over the period studied. This was the case both in crime movies and non-crime movies.Between 1970 and 2020 there was a 70% increase in the amount of murderous language used, according to Brad Bushman, who was one of the researchers.He told PsyPost: ""It is troubling that the use of violent verbs is increasing so much in movies, and that violence is viewed as entertainment.""""The world depicted in movies is far more violent than the actual world,"" he said.Another of the researchers, Amir Tohidi, blamed the competitive movie industry for the rise in violent language.

It can be caused by injury or disease, and Alzheimer's disease is by far the most common cause.In most cases, there is no cure. But there are ways to reduce the risk of developing dementia, or at least delay it, slow its effects, and manage its symptoms.And a number of studies have found that speaking a second language may actually help.A 2007 study found that bilingual people developed symptoms of dementia four years later than monolingual people. And a 2013 study found that bilingualism delayed dementia by 4.5 years.A number of studies have looked into why this might happen.One reason might be that bilingualism could help increase functional connectivity in our brains — the activation of different parts of the brain as they work together — and this may help delay dementia.It's also been found that bilingualism may affect the volume and density of different parts of the brain.For example, a 2024 study from Canada's Concordia University found that monolingual older adults with Alzheimer's disease had reduced hippocampal volume — but bilingual older adults did not.The hippocampus is a small part of the brain that aids in learning and memory, including remembering words. It turns short-term memories into long-term memories by organizing, storing and retrieving them.And reduced hippocampal volume has been connected to declines in things like memory and our ability to relate visual information to the space around us.Of course, speaking a second language is far from the only thing we can do to reduce the risk of dementia.The Alzheimer Society of Canada recommends keeping both physically and socially active, protecting your heart health, and getting help if you have symptoms of depression. It also recommends sleeping well, not smoking and avoiding excessive alcohol consumption.The Alzheimer Society further recommends checking for hearing loss, which it says can increase the risk of dementia by an average of 90%.","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on the findings of these studies?2.Do you find it surprising that bilingualism may reduce the risk of dementia?3.Are many of your friends and family bilingual?4.How old were you when you started learning a second language?5.Do you think a cure for dementia will ever be found?","Exercise 4Further Discussion Have a discussion based on the following questions.1.What would you say are the main advantages of being bilingual?2.If you were to start learning a new language tomorrow, which would you pick?3.Are there any languages you started learning but gave up on?4.What languages are most popular among language learners in your country?5.The deepest connection you have with someone and their culture is through learning their language. — Maria J.

But the longer you study, you'll probably want to really sound like a native speaker.So how can you make your speech sound more natural?First of all, make sure you know your grammar, says Emile Dodds from the Leonardo English website.  ""Bad grammar will hold you back,"" he says. However, that doesn't mean you have to speak like the King of England. In fact, sometimes you should do the opposite!When native speakers talk naturally, they use things like contractions and filler words.And contractions aren't just things like ""can't"" and ""won't.""  Native speakers also shorten ""going to"" to ""gonna"" or ""got to"" to ""gotta.""  You wouldn't use these in writing, but they sound natural when speaking.Filler words — words that fill space — are great because they sound natural, but also give you time to think. These are little words like ""so,"" ""um"" and ""you know.""For example, you might say: ""So, I was thinking, um, are you doing anything later?""According to the website Dan's Real English: ""It's really important to use fillers — but not too often!""And while you might have learned in school to answer questions in full sentences, it's not something you need to do in casual conversation.Of course, learning to speak naturally takes time.

It's a critically endangered language from northern Japan.Ainu, or Aynu itak as the Ainu people call it, was once spoken across Hokkaido in Japan, as well as southern Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands. It is not related to any other language and is very different from Japanese.It's not clear how many people speak Ainu today. It has disappeared from Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands — and it almost disappeared from Hokkaido too.According to UNESCO there were only 15 Ainu speakers in 2009 — and probably no one speaks Ainu for daily conversation.However, a 2006 Hokkaido government survey found that a few hundred people had some understanding of the Ainu language.When a language disappears, a people's traditions, stories, songs and culture disappear too. Realizing this, the Ainu people are now trying to revive their language.The Foundation for Ainu Culture organizes Ainu language classes in several areas around Hokkaido, and some universities around Japan also offer Ainu language courses. A 2011 study from Kyoto Sangyo University found that the number of young people taking Ainu language classes was increasing.In Hokkaido, STV Radio broadcasts an Ainu language beginner's course, which can be downloaded as a podcast. And on YouTube, the Sito Channel teaches everyday phrases along with Ainu culture.In December, a new Ainu language course book was published, called Ainu-go wo hanashite miyo! or ""Let's try speaking Ainu!"" A new Ainu grammar book was also published in January.

If they go somewhere without permission, they are said to be ""AWOL,"" or ""Absent Without Leave.""Both expressions, like many other military expressions, are also used in other situations.For example, if a driver hasn't come back from a job when expected, their boss might say, ""Someone call John; he's MIA."" But if the driver didn't come to work at all, the boss might say, ""If John is AWOL one more time he'll lose his job!""All members of the military learn how to march, or walk in time. Sometimes they are told to march in ""double time,"" which means to march at twice the normal speed. An expression that comes from ""double time"" is ""on the double"" which means ""very fast.""So John's coworker might call him and say, ""You need to get to work on the double!""Radar is a technology that can be used by the military to find enemy planes. One way for a plane to not be seen by radar is to fly very close to the ground, or ""under the radar.""  So this expression has come to mean ""to not be noticed"" or ""to do something secretly.""So when John gets to work his coworker might say, ""The boss is really angry with you.

And anyone playing board games with him was expected to let him win.He was also obsessed with gaining access to the Chinese market, and so considered cooperating with Chinese authorities by allowing access to citizens' user data and censoring users' posts.Wynn-Williams also accuses Joel Kaplan, who is now Meta's chief global affairs officer, of harassment and making inappropriate comments. She was fired after she reported his behavior.In response to a complaint filed by Meta, emergency arbitrator Nicholas A. Gowen last week placed a hold on Wynn-Williams promoting the book or making further ""critical claims"" about her former employer. Meta says that a non-disparagement agreement signed by Wynn-Williams should prohibit the book.However, Flatiron can still publish and promote Careless People.A statement from Meta praised the arbitrator's decision, saying it showed ""that Sarah Wynn-Williams' false and defamatory book should never have been published.""Flatiron also issued a statement, saying that the arbitrator had not addressed the allegations made by Wynn-Williams.""The book went through a thorough editing and vetting process, and we remain committed to publishing important books such as this.

This word is short for brother, and the ""uv"" at the end comes from how some Londoners pronounce ""th"" as a ""v"" or ""f"" sound. And just like you can call a mate ""bruv,"" you can use ""fam"" — short for family — for both your friends and your relations.If a Londoner calls someone ""fit,"" they don't just mean the person looks like they exercise, but that they look good. You might also hear a really attractive person being described as ""well fit.""In English slang, it's not unusual for a negative word to be used to mean something good. An example of this in London slang is ""sick,"" which can actually mean ""good"" or ""cool."" Also, the word ""wicked,"" which usually means ""evil"" in English, is used for ""cool"" too.Other words for saying something is good or cool include ""safe"" and ""banging."" A ""banger,"" on the other hand, is a really good song.You might hear Londoners end a lot of sentences with ""innit?"" This word is an even shorter version of the contraction ""isn't it?""

How Your Brain Processes Pitch in SpeechHumans have been speaking to one another for at least 70,000 years. But researchers still aren't entirely sure how our brains make sense of the words we hear.For example, scientists had believed that a ridge on the  brain called the superior temporal gyrus was the main region for processing all parts of speech.However, researchers in the US and France have now found that a different ridge on the brain, called Heschl's gyrus, plays an important role in identifying and categorizing pitch in speech.Their study focused on ""pitch accents,"" which are the rises and falls in the pitch of words — or parts of words — that can help indicate a speaker's intention.Pitch accent is especially important in languages like Norwegian and Japanese, where many words change in meaning depending on their spoken pitch.For example, in Japanese, ""rain"" and ""candy"" are both written phonetically as ame. But ""rain"" (AH-meh) has a higher pitch on the first syllable, while ""candy"" (ah-MEH) has a higher pitch on the second.In English, meanwhile, rising pitch suggests new or important information.The researchers implanted electrodes in the brains of 11 people, who then listened to a narrative from the book Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. While both the superior temporal gyrus and Heschl's gyrus responded to the narrative, Heschl's gyrus was better at distinguishing between different pitch accents.The researchers even found that Heschl's gyrus had already arranged pitch features into meaningful categories — so this aspect of speech is processed in the brain earlier than had been believed.Study author Bharath Chandrasekaran said this is the first study to investigate how subtle variations in pitch are processed in the brain.The team did a similar test on macaques. They found that macaque brains could respond to pitch and intensity, but didn't categorize pitch accents in any meaningful way.The researchers suggest that experience with pitch accents is necessary for the brain to be able to process them as distinct from other aspects of sound — making them possibly a unique feature of human speech and understanding.","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on the findings of this study?2.Do you find it surprising that scientists still don't fully understand how the brain processes speech?3.Do you tend to pay attention to pitch or intonation when speaking English?4.What do you find most difficult about English pronunciation?5.In your opinion, what languages sound the most beautiful?","Exercise 4Further Discussion Have a discussion based on the following questions.1.What languages do you think you'd find the hardest to learn?2.Are there any languages you find a bit harsh or unpleasant to listen to?3.What do you imagine your language sounds like to English speakers?4.What do you imagine people learning your language struggle with the most?5.If you were to start learning a new language tomorrow, which would you pick?"

Let's look at each one and how they can improve your writing.1. What am I trying to say?Orwell believed that one cause of bad prose was writers only having a general idea of what they are trying to say.   He said that it's important to think carefully about what you want to communicate.2. What words will express it?Orwell argued that knowing what you are trying to say allows you to choose the best words to say it. If you're not exactly sure what you're trying to say, Orwell said, you're more likely to use what he called ""stale"" language to express yourself.3. What image or idiom will make it clearer?Using an image or idiom can help explain an idea. However, Orwell said writers must make sure these are new and interesting.4. Is this image fresh enough to have an effect?Orwell said that a new expression is much better at creating a strong idea in people's minds and helping them understand what you are trying to say than a well-known one. He argued that old phrases have lost their power to create ideas in people's minds.Orwell also offered two more useful questions for writers to ask themselves: ""Could I put it more shortly?"" and ""Have I said anything that is avoidably ugly?""","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on George Orwell's questions for writers?2.Have you read any of Orwell's works?

It comes from Tagalog, a language spoken in the Philippines. Gigil is the strong feeling you get when something is so cute, you want to squeeze or pinch it!Another Filipino word, videoke, is a mix of ""video"" and ""karaoke,"" and is often done with a screen and scoring. The OED also added salakot, a traditional hat worn by Filipino farmers, and sando, a kind of vest.From Malaysia and Singapore, there's alamak, a word for when something surprising or upsetting happens. Food words were also added, including tapau (to take out food) and ketupat (rice cakes wrapped in leaves).South Africa brought in some colorful terms. Yoh is a word from South Africa used to show surprise or shock — and it's been around since 1855.Other words from South Africa include gatvol, a slang word that means ""annoyed,"" and sharp-sharp — a friendly way to say hello or goodbye.From Ireland, the OED added blaa, a soft bread roll, and ludraman, a word for someone who is lazy or stupid.These words may not have started in English, but now they help English speakers describe the world in new and exciting ways!","Exercise 3QuestionsAnswer the following questions about the article.1.How many foreign language words were added in the OED's latest update?2.What language does the word gigil come from?3.What is a friendly way to say hello or goodbye in South Africa?","Exercise 4DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on the new words added to the OED?2.Which of the words featured in the article did you find interesting?3.Has English borrowed many words from your language?4.Does your language borrow a lot of words from English?5.Are there any common words in your native language that are difficult to explain in English?"

They found that using short, common expressions can make you sound more fluent when you speak.In the study, 102 Japanese speakers gave speeches in English. Then, 10 language experts listened and judged how fluent each speaker sounded.They found that speakers who correctly used simple, everyday, two-word phrases were seen as more fluent by the experts.However, speaking without too many pauses was still the most important part of sounding fluent.But using natural phrases made a difference too.

In fact, ""noisome"" is related to the word ""annoy"" rather than ""noise.""""Suffrage"" might look like the noun form of the verb ""suffer,"" but it actually refers to the right to vote. If you're interested in history, you may have seen the word ""suffragette,"" which was the name given to women who fought for the right to vote.In English, the prefix ""in"" is often used to make words negative, like for example, ""correct"" and ""incorrect,"" or ""expensive"" and ""inexpensive.""  But something that's ""invaluable,"" is actually very valuable or useful —  so much so that it's hard to say just how valuable it is!And here's an invaluable warning: ""inflammable"" doesn't mean that something can't be set on fire, but that it can very easily be set on fire.There are also examples of the similarity between words causing their meaning to change over time. For example, the original meaning of ""enormity"" is ""an immoral or illegal act."" But because it looks and sounds like ""enormous,"" over time it became common to use it to talk about size. Today, most dictionaries include both the original and newer meaning of ""enormity.""","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.Which of the phantonyms in the article did you find interesting?2.Have you come across any confusing English words recently?3.What English grammar concepts do you find most confusing?4.Are phantonyms found in your language?5.Do you know of any words in your language that have changed in meaning over time?","Exercise 4Further Discussion Have a discussion based on the following questions.1.What do you imagine English speakers struggle with most often when learning your language?2.What languages is your native tongue most similar to?3.Besides English, what languages would you like to be fluent in? 4.Are there any languages that you started learning but didn't continue with?5.Do you think you'd enjoy working as a language teacher?"

So if you are playing a video game against a friend who doesn't know what to do, beating them would be ""like shooting fish in a barrel.""Similarly, a duck floating on a lake is much easier to shoot than a flying one, so if someone is easy to attack or beat, you can also say they are ""like a sitting duck.""When someone is trying their best at something — even if they're not doing it very well — you can say they are ""giving it their best shot"".In fact, it's common to refer to an attempt or try as a ""shot,"" and this meaning appears in many expressions. A ""long shot,"" for example, is an attempt that is probably not going to be successful.In hunting, animals are often called ""game,"" and if you're allowed to hunt them, they're ""fair game."" So this phrase is also used to say that it's okay to attack or criticize someone or something.If you ""set your sights on something,"" you decide to achieve it.

You might want to try a book subscription service!These services aren't new, but they've become popular with book lovers, and are offered by more and more companies and bookshops. Last year, The Times called it the ""craze shaking up publishing.""A book subscription is just like a subscription you might have with a magazine or a newspaper. Companies send people a new book, or a number of new books, every month — and the books are theirs to keep.You don't choose which books you get, however — the companies choose them for you, although you can often choose the genre. For example, you might purchase a romance subscription, which means the company will send you a different romance novel each month.Some companies even include extra gifts like mugs, pins or candy. One UK subscription service called TeaTimeBookshop sends tea, coffee or hot chocolate with the book, as well as some cookies!The idea is that readers get books they might not choose on their own, perhaps from authors who aren't well known or who share stories from unique perspectives.Authors say the subscriptions are also a good way to help get their books to customers in an extremely competitive market. For a new author, having your book sent out as part of a subscription service is a big deal.Some services have even begun publishing their own books.  However, some have worried that these services will start to favor books they publish themselves over other books that subscribers might prefer to read.Of course, book subscriptions aren't for everyone — and they may not replicate the pleasure of looking around a library or bookshop.

The NIH is a government-funded body that provides research grants.The areas most affected by these cuts, according to Nature, were studies related to HIV/AIDS and the health of transgender people, as well as those linked to COVID-19 and climate change.Aix-Marseille University's president Eric Berton said he expected the school to be able to raise up to around $17 million to support the Safe Place For Science program for about 15 researchers for three years.The university said that of the 298 applications it received, 242 were considered eligible. Berton added that many applications came through encrypted messaging.Aix-Marseille is not alone — a number of European universities have encouraged US-based academics to consider a move across the Atlantic.Nature's analysis found that educational institutions across the US — both in states that supported Trump and those that supported his rival Kamala Harris in the latest election — have seen funding cut.Some researchers have argued that these cuts will have serious consequences for important disease research.

Breathing Exercises May HelpIt's normal to feel nervous before a test. But if you get so nervous that you feel nauseous, get a headache, sweat, or perhaps feel afraid, depressed or overwhelmed, you may be experiencing test anxiety.Handling test anxiety is important — it's even been found that students with greater test anxiety get lower grades than those who feel less of this anxiety. And researchers in Turkey wanted to see if there was a simple way to help students with this feeling.In Turkey, students in grade eight — typically around 14 years old — take a centralized high school entrance exam that tests them in math, science, social studies, foreign languages and Turkish. There's a lot of pressure to do well in the exam to get into the best high schools, which will then help students get into top universities.For the study, 162 grade eight students in two different middle schools were introduced to a breathing exercise program three months before the exam, designed to help them relax and control their stress.Twice a week over eight weeks, the students were led through a 15- to 20-minute program of breathing exercises, which they did before school.The program included things like using the diaphragm to take deep breaths, or doing the ""lion's breath"" from yoga, where you stick out your tongue and exhale forcefully. Students were also taught ways to manage stress, including techniques for reducing stress-producing thoughts.Before and after the program, the students completed a test that scored their levels of anxiety.And by the end of the eight-week program, it was found that their anxiety scores decreased by an average of 11%.The authors say their results show that using breathing exercises in school could be a cheap, effective way to reduce anxiety in middle school students, especially as they prepare for important exams.So if you've got a test coming up and you're feeling anxious and overwhelmed … first, just breathe.","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on the findings of this study? 2.Have you ever experienced test anxiety?

Ad hominem is a Latin term that literally means ""to the person.""Online, ad hominem attacks are often simply abusive — calling people stupid, or criticizing their spelling — and they can turn a debate into a tennis match of personal insults.In politics, they're often used as a way to discredit a rival.For example, let's say a country's minister for health is known to be a smoker, or is always seen eating junk food. Critics may say that this makes the person unqualified to be in charge of the department for health.But as long as the politician's personal life doesn't influence their professional decisions, we could describe these criticisms as ad hominem attacks — and they can actually make us lose sight of the decisions a politician has made.But according to philosopher Douglas Walton, on some occasions — for example, if a politician has been caught lying, or in situations that suggest they may not be good moral judges — attacking the person might be fair, especially if they're telling people to vote for them because they can be trusted to be honest or moral.So where do we draw the line? In Scientific American, Raley suggested asking ourselves how relevant a politician's character is to their ability to perform in office — or how relevant a person's past is to their knowledge of an issue.But if you're just calling someone stupid because they disagree, that's probably not appropriate.","Exercise 3Discussion1.What are your thoughts on the ad hominem fallacy?2.How often do you come across ad hominem attacks online?3.Which of your friends or family do you argue with most often?4.Do you know anyone who's impossible to argue with?5.Do you have any coworkers that you often disagree with?","Exercise 4Further Discussion 1.Do you often get into online arguments?2.Do you know anyone who's argumentative with strangers?3.How would you rate your debating skills?4.Do you think you'd enjoy being a politician?5.It is better to debate a question without settling it, than to settle a question without debating it. — Joseph Joubert.

Boys are also less likely to be read to than girls.The survey also found generational differences, with Generation Z parents — those under the age of 29 — more likely to describe reading as a subject to learn, rather than a fun thing to do.

So here are some tips to help make your stories more interesting and enjoyable.Write for the SensesA simple way to make your writing feel more personal and real is to use all of the senses to describe things. Don't just say what happened, say how it looked, sounded, smelled, or felt. This is an easy way to add more texture and variety to your writing.Introduce OppositesReal people are complex and often contain contradictions, and good characters and stories should, too. So if you introduce an idea in your writing, try including its opposite as well.For example, if a character is wrong about something, show us why they think they're right. Or if a character wants to do good, put them in a situation where they must be bad.Introducing opposites can help make your characters more real and bring conflict to your plot, making your story more interesting.RewriteDon't be so afraid of writing something bad that you don't write anything at all. Even very good writers must rewrite their work many times before it's finished.So just get started and keep going! You can always fix it later.Share Your StoriesAlthough it can be frightening, sharing your writing with others is one of the best ways to get new ideas, find problems and improve it.But try to ask someone who will be honest with you about what doesn't work. For example, your mother or partner may not be as honest because they don't want to hurt your feelings.","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.Which of the tips in the article did you find interesting?2.Have you done any creative writing?

Humans also actively teach the software through what's called ""supervised learning.""As a result of this combing and human training, it's been suggested that AI programs like ChatGPT are changing the way we write.For example, in an article for The Conversation last September, Ritesh Chugh from Central Queensland University said the use of words such as ""delves,"" ""showcasing"" and ""meticulous"" has increased in academic writing. He blames AI.These are proper words, but they're rather flowery, and usually not used very frequently.This change in frequency might be a problem, Chugh said, because it can lead to our writing ""losing its personal touch,"" as we use words that may not look like real human writing.Others aren't so worried by it. Language researcher Ezequiel López said AI is ""democratizing the ability to communicate,"" as weaker writers and even language learners use it to perfect their writing.But if we're using AI to help with written work, Chugh suggests that we edit it to replace words that are ""appearing again and again.""  He adds that we can also ask the software to give us more straightforward language by changing our prompts.And of course, anyone using the software for academic purposes should be sure not to copy large pieces of text from AI for use in their own assignments!","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.Have you ever read something and thought: ""It sounds like AI wrote this""?2.How often do you use AI to help with writing?

You might think to yourself, ""Holy moly, these are expensive!""  This phrase is used in a similar way as ""oh my God,"" and you can say it when you're surprised by something.Let's say you're in the car on the way home from the cinema and someone rear-ends you. After checking the damage to the car, you might say to your partner, ""Don't worry, it's just a fender bender"" — meaning a small accident.But after talking for a few minutes to the person who crashed into you, you might have to say, ""Alright.

And this seems to be scaring away travelers.The manga, The Future I Saw, based on a dream diary Tatsuki kept, was first published in 1999. The book attracted attention because its cover predicted a great disaster in March 2011 — which was when Japan experienced a major earthquake and tsunami that also caused a nuclear disaster in Fukushima prefecture.Although the book was out of print, it was republished with additional material in 2021, along with a new prediction on the cover: ""The real disaster will come in July 2025.""This version of the book has now sold almost a million copies — and is also available in Chinese and Korean.According to Bloomberg, there has been a big drop in airline bookings from South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong since April, which is being linked to Tatsuki's prediction. Bookings from Hong Kong in particular are down by 50% compared to last year, and bookings between late June and early July have dropped by 83%.Greater Bay Airlines and Hong Kong Airlines have both reduced the number of flights to Japan as a result.The drop in tourist bookings this summer goes against the general trend, with Japan becoming increasingly popular as a tourist destination since the end of the coronavirus pandemic. A record 3.9 million people visited Japan in April.In April, Yoshiro Murai, the governor of Miyagi prefecture, asked people not to take the prediction seriously, because it was affecting local tourism.As for Tatsuki herself, she told the Mainichi Shimbun, ""I hope that this interest will lead to safety measures and preparedness.""","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.Do you find it surprising that the prediction in The Future I Saw has affected travel bookings to Japan? 2.Have you read The Future I Saw?

A gap year is usually taken between high school and university, but can also be taken at any time during your studies. They're much more common in Europe than the US.Taking a gap year doesn't mean you stop learning, and can actually be an excellent chance to build new skills. If you travel during your gap year, you can get to know about different cultures and learn another language.Traveling abroad during your gap year, especially if you have never lived away from home before, can also help a young person become more mature and independent.A lot of people use their gap year to volunteer, and doing this can help you get experience in industries you might like to work in. For example, if you think you'd like to become a teacher you could volunteer for projects that work with children. Any work you do during your gap year will help you build your resume.However, a gap year isn't a good idea for everyone. Not everyone can afford to travel and volunteer for a whole year, so they may not get as much useful experience from taking time off their studies.If you don't use your gap year well, it can just be a waste of time, and some people might find it difficult to return to their studies.

Noncognitive skills are things like communicative and social skills, self-control, and the ability to work in a team.A Japanese research team wanted to know how the skills learned in preschool would affect people's behavior later in life.To do so, they looked at the expansion of preschool education in the 1960s and its long-term effects on the risky behaviors of teenagers. Between 1964 and 1970, the Japanese government promoted preschool education and increased the enrollment rate from 18% to 39%.Although the central government promoted preschool expansion, different regional governments increased preschool enrollment to different degrees: some by over 40% and others by as little as 8%. This variation actually made the later effects of the expansion clearer for the researchers.The researchers then looked at rates of violent crime among teenagers and rates of teenage pregnancies before and after the preschool expansion.They found that the preschool expansion reduced teenage violent crime by 34% and teenage pregnancy by 17% compared to average rates before the expansion.These effects particularly stand out because Japan already had low rates of teenage crime and teenage pregnancy compared to other developed countries. And because Japanese preschool education is a universal program that serves all socioeconomic backgrounds, the results show that preschool education can bring long-term benefits to society at large.The researchers also found that increased preschool enrollment did not result in an increase in high school or college enrollment, which suggests that the decrease in risky behaviors wasn't because teenagers were too busy with school.The researchers suggest the decrease in risky behaviors may be due to the development of noncognitive skills in preschool, and that this needs further study.","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on the findings of this study?2.Do you find it surprising that preschool education can help reduce risky behaviors among teenagers?3.Do you think schools in your country do a good job teaching noncognitive skills?4.At what age do kids usually start preschool in your country?5.What are some of your earliest memories of school?","Exercise 4Further Discussion Have a discussion based on the following questions.1.What were your favorite subjects at school?2.Which of your school teachers did you get along with best?3.Were you a well-behaved student in school?4.Did you have any unruly classmates when you were in high school?5.The first five years have so much to do with how the next 80 turn out. — Bill Gates.

At times, this was a way for queer people to identify one another when it wasn't safe to be open about their sexuality.Over time, a lot of this language has become part of our shared pop culture. It's even common slang among Gen Z — generally those born between 1997 and 2012.A big part of this is a result of the popularity of LGBTQ+ media, like the reality TV show RuPaul's Drag Race. And queer slang — particularly drag queen slang — has been picked up on platforms like TikTok and shared with a global audience.So what are the terms you need to know, and where are they from?Let's ""spill the tea!""This phrase comes straight from African American drag culture, and means ""to gossip.""  The ""tea"" comes from the first letter of ""truth"" —  T!Drag culture has given us a lot of slang commonly used today, with much of it coming from ballroom culture. This is a subculture that began in New York in the 1970s, where people would compete — or  ""walk"" — in drag and dance competitions.If someone did really well in a ballroom event, they were said to be ""serving.""  And if you wanted to really praise someone, you could say ""slay.""  ""Slay"" usually means ""kill,"" but in this case it just means you've done amazing!And these days you'll see ""slay"" used all over the internet!On the other hand, ""reading"" someone means to directly point out their flaws. And if you prefer to say bad things about someone more indirectly, you might ""throw shade.""Of course, drag slang in mainstream culture isn't new — as early as 1990, Madonna took the ballroom idea of  ""voguing,"" a dance based on doing supermodel-style poses, and made it into her hit song ""Vogue.""So now that we've spilled the tea — go slay!","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on the LGBTQ+ influence on Gen Z slang? 2.Have you come across any of these words or phrases before?3.Have you ever been to a drag show?

For example, a café that has everything on the menu that you could ever want might feel ""tailor-made"" for you.When you do something like ""it's going out of style,"" it means you are doing it often, quickly or in large amounts — like there won't be another chance to do it soon because it will be unavailable or unpopular. If your friend is drinking one cup of coffee after another, you might say they are drinking it ""like it's going out of style.""Seams are where the different pieces of material are joined together to make clothes. So if something is ""falling apart at the seams,"" it is in bad condition or close to failing. The phrase can also be used when things go very wrong. So if the café gets too busy and the staff start making a lot of mistakes, you could say it's ""falling apart at the seams.""Kid leather, made from goats, is a very soft material.

However, a new study from Australia suggests that for children learning English as a second language in school, it can take at least six years.The research was done by the Australian Education Research Organisation (AERO). It looked at how long it took students learning English as a second language to develop the skills they needed to allow them to learn equally well from the same curriculum as students who spoke English as a first language.It found that students who started in New South Wales schools with a beginner level of English could expect to follow the wider school curriculum as well as their native English-speaking classmates after an average of six years.These results were based on data collected over nine years from more than 110,000 students learning English as a second language.While Australia is an English-speaking country, around 30% of students come from backgrounds where English is not their first language. And around 25% are actively learning English as a second language.Even students who begin school with intermediate English may need extra support. The research found that these students still needed around three years to catch up to their native English-speaking peers.But AERO's research also found significant differences among children's language development depending on their background and life experiences.Children facing socioeconomic disadvantages took an average of 22% longer to learn English compared to more advantaged children. And students from refugee backgrounds took 14% longer to learn English than non-refugee students.The CEO of AERO, Jenny Donovan, noted that students who come from different language backgrounds can do well in Australia's education system — even doing better than native English-speaking students in many cases.

However, recent plane crashes may be affecting ticket sales.On January 29, American Airlines flight 5342 collided with an army helicopter over the Potomac River near Washington DC, killing everyone on both aircraft.This was followed by another accident on February 17, when a Delta Air Lines flight from Minneapolis landed upside down in Toronto, Canada. And while this time no one was killed, many were taken to hospital.The North American accidents happened a short time after two major international crashes. On December 29, 2024, a Jeju Air flight crashed in Muan, South Korea, killing all but two people aboard. And an Azerbaijan Airlines flight crashed in Kazakhstan on December 25, 2024, killing more than half of the people on the plane.Now American Airlines and Delta Air Lines say ticket sales and revenues are down. According to CNN, Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian told a JP Morgan conference that the airline saw a fall in travel bookings almost immediately after the crashes in Washington and Toronto.The CEO of American Airlines, Robert Isom, also said that the Washington crash  was one of the major reasons for the company's reduced revenue forecasts for the first quarter of 2025. But he added that the airline's focus is to ""take care of the families of those victims,"" CNN reported.So is air travel safe? Despite the recent crashes, the statistics still say ""yes.""

Take a look at the cooking mistakes below and see what your score is out of four!1. Not reading through the recipe before you start cookingThere's nothing worse than getting to the middle of a recipe for a dinner party and reading the words, ""marinate for at least 24 hours.""  Always read the recipe to the end before you start cooking. Then check that you have every ingredient and the right cooking equipment — and think through the timing and the steps.2. Not tasting food as you cookIf you add spices when you start cooking and don't taste your food again until the end, your dinner might not taste quite as wonderful as you'd hoped. So why not keep a spoon next to you so you can taste the flavors as you go? Don't be afraid to taste, taste, taste. That's what the top chefs do!3. OvercookingWhen you take food off the heat, it will continue to cook. So that lovely steak that you wanted to have rare is now medium-rare. It's the same for vegetables, which is why you'll often see TV chefs putting cooked vegetables into a bowl of ice water to stop them from continuing to cook.To stop overcooking, know your cooking times. And for meat, take it off the heat just before it's finished cooking and allow it to rest for a few minutes.4. Using olive oil to cook everythingIf you're cooking over high heat, don't use olive oil. Olive oil starts to smoke at a much lower temperature than canola oil. After it starts to smoke, it doesn't taste as good and it's less healthy. Instead, use canola oil for high heat and olive oil for medium heat — or for a salad dressing.","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.Have you made any of these cooking mistakes before?2.When was the last time you ruined a dish you were trying to make?3.Do you taste your food a few times while preparing it? 4.What spices do you cook with most often? 5.What type of oil do you usually cook with?

At some onsen, tourists can not only spend time in the water, but also get a massage and enjoy some food.But authorities believe that visitor numbers have contributed to falling water levels at hot springs.Some have said that owners of the springs have been extracting too much water to make sure there is enough for their visitors.Owners of onsen have been encouraged to limit the amount of water that is extracted.According to some reports, local governments are thinking about offering financial support to hot springs, which are important for local economies.The hot spring town of Ginzan Onsen in Yamagata prefecture gets 330,000 visitors a year, with people coming from inside Japan and around the world.However, earlier this year, Ginzan Onsen began limiting the number of visitors arriving for day trips.

Between July and September, all hikers will have to pay the 4,000 yen fee.Officials are worried about the large numbers of people climbing the 3,776-meter volcano, which is very popular with visitors.The idea of introducing fees for all climbers is to improve safety and decrease overcrowding.Yamanashi prefecture also introduced a daily limit of 4,000 climbers on the Yoshida Trail in 2024.This limit and last year's fee may have done a little to help: while more than 204,000 people climbed Mount Fuji in 2024, that's down from 221,000 the previous year, even as tourism to Japan increased.However, Natsuko Sodeyama, who works for Shizuoka prefecture, told AFP that although numbers have decreased a little, more than 200,000 climbers is ""still huge.""This summer, climbers on the Shizuoka trails will also not be able to begin hiking after 2 p.m. if they don't have a reservation for a mountain hut.Last year, Yamanashi stopped people from climbing after 4 p.m. without a reservation.

And this month, Singapore Airlines, Cathay Pacific and Hong Kong Airlines are introducing a similar ban on passengers using power banks or charging them from their plane's power outlets.The low-cost carrier AirAsia is also banning passengers from using and charging power banks, and from storing them in overhead compartments.But while China Airlines and Taiwan's EVA Air have banned passengers from using or charging power banks on their flights, these airlines still allow power banks to be stored in overhead compartments.Although power banks in good condition are generally safe, old or damaged power banks can catch fire if they come into contact with other metal objects, or if there are big changes in temperature and pressure — like airplanes experience during takeoff and landing.Experts recommend checking your power bank for damage before you travel, putting tape on the power bank to prevent it from contacting other metal objects, and packing it in a plastic bag to protect it.","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on some airlines in Asia changing their rules about power banks?2.Do you think airlines in other parts of the world should introduce similar rules? 3.Do you usually bring a power bank with you when you fly?4.Have you ever had any issues trying to bring a certain item on a plane? 5.What do you hate most about packing for a flight?","Exercise 4Further Discussion Have a discussion based on the following questions.1.Do you usually pack light when you travel?2.Have you ever forgotten to pack something important for a trip?3.Do you tend to pack your bags last minute or do you usually plan ahead?4.What are some things you never travel without?5.Has an airline ever lost your luggage?

The idea is simple, but risky: arrive at the airport just before your flight boards — sometimes only 15 minutes early — and try to make it through security in time.People doing this will check in online and bring only carry-on bags. This means they don't have to go to the check-in desk, and can go straight to security instead.This trend is growing on TikTok, where users post videos of themselves rushing through the airport. Some users have posted videos where they make it to their gate quickly, even in big, busy airports.But many others aren't so lucky, and have shared videos where they've missed their flights.So while it might work for a few lucky travelers, most experts don't recommend trying ""airport theory.""Security checks take time, and before you even get to the airport, you might get stuck in traffic or have other delays. And after security, it can also take time to find your gate, especially in larger airports.That's why most airports still recommend arriving two hours before domestic flights and three hours before international ones.Airport theory might look exciting online, but it doesn't work for everyone. For most people, getting to the airport earlier is a safer and more comfortable way to travel.","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on the airport theory?

This means it takes everyone longer to get on and off their trains, slowing down departure times.According to  The Mainichi newspaper, some commuters are complaining on social media about young people not knowing how to get on and off trains — and suggesting companies teach new workers how to do it!A survey by the Japan Private Railway Association has even listed the most annoying behavior when getting on and off trains — so we know what we shouldn't do!By far the most annoying behavior, named by 66% of people, is not moving away from the doors when other people are trying to get off. People standing near the doors should get off the train for a moment to let people off, and then get back on again.The next most annoying behavior, named by 18% of people, is trying to get on the train before other people get off.Other annoying behaviors include jumping on the train at the last minute, cutting in line and pushing.According to The Mainichi, railway operators suggest passengers think about the people around them when getting on and off trains.

Have little green men visited our small, blue planet? Your answer to those questions is probably ""no, of course not!"" But others might disagree.On June 14, 1947, W.W. Brazel and his son were driving through the desert near Roswell, New Mexico, where they saw a strange wreckage. A few weeks later Brazel returned to collect some pieces of it, which he took to Roswell's sheriff, George Wilcox.Neither man knew what the wreckage was, and so Wilcox reported it to the army. After seeing the wreckage for themselves, the army announced that it was a ""flying disc.""  Then, the next day, they quickly changed their story, saying that the wreckage was of a weather balloon.But it was too late: the world had already started to believe that the ""flying disc"" was an alien spaceship. And some people still believe it to this day.So did aliens really land in Roswell? That depends on who you ask. But according to Roger Launius, from the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum, the army may have first encouraged the idea of a ""flying disc"" because, at the time, doing so was easier than admitting what they now say is the truth — that the wreckage came from a secret army balloon used to spy on Russia.Whatever happened out there in the desert, Roswell's economy is happy that it did.

Here are four other places to visit in the land of the pharaohs.Abu SimbelIn southern Egypt, near the border of Sudan, is Abu Simbel, two temples honoring the pharaoh Ramses II and his wife Nefertari. Four 20-meter statues of Ramses II can be found outside the temple, while inside visitors can see many hieroglyphic drawings on the walls.When the Aswan High Dam was built, Abu Simbel was almost lost because of rising waters in the Nile River. However, in the 1960s, the temples were taken apart and rebuilt in a higher location, where they can be found today.Hatshepsut TempleThis temple was built to honor Hatshepsut, one of Egypt's few female pharaohs. She ruled for 20 years — more than any other known female ruler. The temple is found in Deir el-Bahari, near the city of Luxor, and was built into the side of a mountain more than 3,000 years ago.Valley of the KingsThe Valley of the Kings can also be found nearby. Here, about 60 tombs have been found inside the mountains. One of these is Tutankhamun's tomb, which became famous when it was opened in 1922. This was because, unlike the other tombs in the valley, its contents had not been stolen. The treasures found inside can now be seen in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.Karnak Temple ComplexThe Karnak Temple complex is found near Luxor, and at about 1 square kilometer, it is the second largest religious site in the world, after Angkor Wat in Cambodia.

Most bags are found and returned to their owners.  But if a bag is still not found after three weeks, it's considered lost.Sometimes bags are found, but passengers just don't claim them. When that happens in the US, the luggage is sent to a company called Unclaimed Baggage, which buys and resells items from unclaimed suitcases.Usually, these unclaimed bags have things like clothes, shoes or shampoo in them. But sometimes, what's inside is very unusual.Last year, the company found some very strange items, including a suit of armor, a Roman helmet, and even a freeze-dried chicken's foot. Other finds included a magician's hat and a book about exorcisms.But perhaps the strangest find of all was a very heavy suitcase filled with nothing but rocks.You won't find any of these strange items in the Unclaimed Baggage shop, but you can find some luxury items for sale.For example, in one of the lost bags there was a diamond ring worth nearly $40,000.

This pass would be updated automatically if any changes were made to the booking.Instead of doing check-ins, passengers' faces would be scanned to notify airlines when they have arrived for their flight.If passengers have luggage to check in, their faces will be scanned at the bag drop-off point. But if they just have carry-on luggage, they will be scanned at the security gates.The use of facial recognition technology means passengers won't need to show passports or phones as they travel through the airport, and it should also shorten the time spent going through security.What's more, passengers who miss connecting flights because of delays will also have an easier time. Instead of going to an airline desk to get a new booking and boarding pass, they will automatically receive a notification from the airline with new flight details and an update to their journey pass.To make these changes possible, airport infrastructure will need to be updated with facial recognition technology and the ability to read passports from mobile devices. However, to protect people's privacy, airport computers should only verify that faces match passports and not store passengers' information.According to the ICAO, these plans for passport uploads and face scans, which have been described as the biggest changes to the aviation industry in 50 years, could come into effect within three years.","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on ICAO's plans to introduce a digital travel credential?2.Do you think most airports will be ready for this kind of change in three years?3.Do you have any concerns about the use of facial recognition at airports?4.Have you ever had issues checking in for a flight?

The many layers make the sword strong.Johan is from southern Switzerland, and he first fell in love with Japanese swords when he saw one at an exhibition in his home country.

This is similar to black pudding, but does not have any blood in it, and is instead made from fat and oatmeal.Tikka MasalaWhile nobody is quite certain, many people believe that this curry dish was invented in a South Asian restaurant in Glasgow, Scotland.Traditionally made with chicken and spices in a tomato-cream sauce, tikka masala is served with rice and best enjoyed with a Scottish ale.

Called Hatena Kohiten, it's named after the Japanese word hatena, which means ""question mark,"" while kohiten just means ""cafe.""Just like a normal cafe, it has a full drinks menu with hot and cold soft drinks, as well as alcohol. It has a relaxing atmosphere and a nice interior.

However, they should order at least one drink for 500 yen (around $4) and one mystery for 1,500 yen (around $11).The mysteries include detective stories and science fiction space trips, and they're graded, so if you haven't tried something like this before, you can start with a beginner's mystery.There's no time limit to solve the mysteries, so you can take your time and enjoy your drink while you figure out secret passwords and how to open locked boxes.

It sounds simple, but getting the sauce smooth and creamy — not clumpy or dry — isn't easy.The usual method involves cooking the pasta, taking some of the starchy water used to make it, and mixing it with cheese and pepper. The starch from the pasta water helps the cheese melt into a sauce.However, small changes in temperature or the amount of starch can cause the cheese to clump. This happens because of something called protein aggregation — when the cheese proteins stick together instead of melting smoothly.So researchers looked for a more reliable way to make the sauce. This is what they came up with.Instead of using pasta water, which can have different levels of starch content, the researchers created a controlled mixture using 5 grams of powdered cornstarch and 50 grams of water. When heated gently, the mixture thickens into a smooth base.Then, add another 100 grams of cold water before mixing in 200 grams of pecorino and some black pepper. Adding cold water into the sauce reduces the chance of it overheating, which can cause the cheese to separate.Finally, the sauce should be added to 300 grams of pasta that's been allowed to cool for a bit. A little pasta water could still be used at the end to change the texture if needed.The scientists tested many different combinations, changing the amount of starch and the temperature. They discovered that using more starch helped keep the sauce from going clumpy, even when the heat wasn't perfectly controlled.This method might not be approved by Italian grandmothers, but for everyone else, it's a reliable way to enjoy perfect cacio e pepe without the clumps!","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.Have you had cacio e pepe?

And it's true that from the outside it looks like it belongs in a fairy tale! Inside, it's a charming place of narrow streets, shops and cafes. But it can get very busy during the summer.Tourists like to visit the medieval castle — Chȃteau Comtal — inside the old city, and walk the ramparts to get a great view of the countryside below.Those who stop for lunch are often recommended to try the cassoulet, a French stew made with meat and beans.However, there's more to Carcassonne than just La Cité, and some tourists miss it.Walk from the walled city across the beautiful Pont-Vieux, which is one of France's oldest bridges, to get to the newer part of Carcassonne: known as ville basse — low town — or Bastide Saint-Louis.It's newer, but it's not new at all! There's still lots of history to explore, as well as lively squares, churches and an art museum.Keep going a little further, and you'll find the Canal du Midi, a 17th century canal recognized by UNESCO.

But if you prefer history to hangovers, why not visit one of Germany's many castles? It's believed that more than 25,000 were built in the country, many of which can still be seen today.Lichtenstein CastleThe first Lichtenstein Fortress was built in the early 12th century, but it was destroyed in 1377. It was rebuilt as a powerful castle in 1390, but became less and less important as it got older.But then, in 1826, the castle was an important part in Wilhelm Hauff's historical novel, Lichtenstein. The book was so popular that it inspired Count Wilhelm of Württemberg to rebuild the castle between 1840 and 1842. This is the same castle we can see today, standing with its tall white tower on top of an 800-meter cliff.Cochem CastleAlso known as the Reichsburg Cochem, Cochem Castle is said to be the largest castle on the Moselle River.The original Cochem Castle is thought to have been built around 1,000 years ago, but it was destroyed in 1689 by French King Louis XIV. The castle's ruins were bought in 1868 by businessman Louis Ravené, who began to rebuild it in a different style to the original — although some parts of the old castle were kept, such as its eight-sided ""Witches Tower.""Burg EltzUnlike the other castles on this list, Burg Eltz was never destroyed during its 850-year history — and even still belongs to its original family.

Try These TipsMost of us would prefer to save our money to spend at our vacation destination rather than using it all just getting there. International travel is rarely cheap, though, especially if you have to fly. However, if you're flexible, there are good deals out there.First, don't just look at one airline when shopping for flights. There are many comparison services that find and track prices from multiple companies. Check out websites like Skyscanner, Google Flights and Expedia. Maybe you'll find better value on a route or airline you hadn't considered before!It's also best to book in advance. There are some last-minute deals that you might get lucky enough to grab, but increased demand for vacations in recent years means the odds are against you. According to research by Skyscanner, you usually get the best prices on flights booked between two and six months in advance — so set up your price alerts early!Expedia's 2025 Air Hacks report also says you'll get the best prices if you buy your flights on a Sunday, while prices will be listed at their highest on a Monday or Friday.Which day of the week you travel on makes a difference too. Expedia's travel hack report says that for international travel, Thursday is the best day to fly if you want to be thrifty.Avoiding busy travel times around holidays will ease the burden on your wallet too, because with more people flying, there are fewer available seats and higher prices.However, while Expedia says the quietest month to travel is February, and the busiest is July, August is actually the cheapest month for travel!","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on these flight hacks?2.What's the best deal you've ever gotten on a flight? 3.What websites do you usually use to book flights?

In fact, it's often said that the country has more sheep than people.It's true! New Zealand is one of just a few countries where sheep outnumber humans. New Zealanders are used to others joking about this fact.However, humans are catching up, according to new government data released this May. With a population of 23.6 million sheep and 5.3 million people, there are about 4.5 sheep for each New Zealander.That's down from 22 sheep per person in 1982, when farming sheep for meat and wool was New Zealand's biggest earner.By land area, New Zealand is about the size of the UK, but it has a human population that is 13 times smaller. That means there's lots of room for sheep.Now, years of falling wool prices caused by the increased use of synthetic fibers across the world have led farmers to change what they do with their land. That means that sheep numbers have fallen.In 2022, there were fewer than five sheep per person, which was the lowest it had ever been. Since then, the country has lost more than 1 million sheep.Toby Williams, from the lobby group Federated Farmers, said sheep farmers have begun using their land for things that will earn them more money, including dairy farming and forestry.He said that New Zealand is in danger of losing its wool industry completely.The government has made plans to slow the industry's decline and has encouraged the use of wool in things like carpets and insulation. But farmers think this may not be enough.Other sheep-farming countries are seeing similar changes. Australia also has more sheep than people — about three animals per person — but its sheep numbers are falling too.","Exercise 3QuestionsAnswer the following questions about the article.1.How many sheep does New Zealand have?2.How many sheep per person did New Zealand have in 1982?3.How many sheep has New Zealand lost since 2022?","Exercise 4DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on the falling number of sheep in New Zealand?2.Are there a lot of sheep in your country?

The Benefits of Letting Gardens Go WildThe UK's weather was quite pleasant at the start of May. The sun even came out! And with the sun, many people stepped into their gardens to cut the grass.However, there's a movement growing almost as fast as the British grass: ""No Mow May.""The idea is to encourage people to put away their lawn mowers and let their grass grow.According to Plantlife, the British organization that runs the annual campaign, a healthy garden ""with some longer grass and wildflowers helps to tackle pollution, benefits wildlife and can even lock away carbon below the ground.""Long grass and wildflowers are perhaps not what people imagine when they think of British gardens.  And it's true that some homeowners would find it difficult to look at an untamed garden.But for others, it's an easy way to do something for the environment — because it requires no effort at all!However, those who want to take things a step further may try ""meadowscaping"" — turning a short-cut lawn into something resembling a meadow.This takes a little more work. But according to the BBC, it's becoming more popular, including among younger, climate-conscious people.Unlike simply not mowing, meadowscaping often means removing all of the grass you have — as well as the weeds — and preparing the soil for more natural types of plants.Stores now often sell mixtures of wildflower seeds that will make your garden look like a natural — and colourful — meadow, with both grasses and flowers.The UK's Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) suggests leaving the soil to settle for four to six weeks before weeding again. Then you can start planting.Garden meadows do still need attention, however. The RHS says that while some weeds can stay, tougher ones will need to be removed, and many people will still trim the grass to make sure it doesn't get too long.If you're worried about what your neighbors might think, some people put up signs to let others know their garden is supposed to look like this!","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on ""No Mow May""?2.Do you find it surprising that wild gardens are better for the environment?3.If you had a lawn, would you consider letting it grow wild?4.How would you feel if your neighbors had untamed lawns or gardens?5.What do you imagine when you think of British gardens?","Exercise 4Further Discussion Have a discussion based on the following questions.1.Do you have a garden?

People choose Airbnbs for the space.""He added: ""Now, we're giving you the best of both worlds — amazing homes with services that make them even more special.""Airbnb users can select these services when they book a stay at a property, or they can just book the service whether they're on a trip or not.For example, right now on the app, an experienced photographer is offering a one-hour photo session in Rome. For about $75, people can get their photo taken in the Italian city in front of an old Fiat 500 car.Airbnb says that all its services are ""vetted for quality,"" and anyone wanting to offer a service has to show that they have ""relevant licenses and certifications.""Those offering their services have an average of 10 years of experience in their fields, the company said.Airbnb is hugely popular around the world; guests spent $81 billion staying at its properties last year.However, the company has also faced plenty of criticism, with residents in some locations even protesting Airbnb.Some complain that short-term rentals have contributed to a housing crisis. With more apartments being used for holiday accommodation, there are fewer properties for local people to live in, which has also pushed prices up.Some cities have introduced restrictions on short-term rentals.

With charming coastal towns and amazing natural beauty, the road is a must-visit destination for travelers wanting an outdoor adventure.Torquay is known as one of Australia's surfing capitals. Here, travelers can explore surf shops, take a surf lesson, or enjoy the sun on beautiful sandy beaches. As you head west, the road hugs the coastline, offering views of limestone cliffs and rainforests.One of the road's most famous highlights is the 12 Apostles, tall limestone formations rising out of the water in the Southern Ocean close to the coastline. These natural wonders, shaped by the wind and water, are best viewed at sunrise or sunset when the golden light shines on the stone.Nearby, you can explore other natural formations such as Loch Ard Gorge and The Arch, a large, bridge-like rock.Great Otway National Park is another stop along the route. This park invites visitors to explore its ancient rainforests, waterfalls and wildlife.A short detour to the south will lead you to the Cape Otway Lightstation, Australia's oldest lighthouse, which offers amazing views of the coastline.Charming towns like Lorne, Apollo Bay and Port Campbell provide perfect spots for a rest. Here, travelers can enjoy fresh local seafood, explore art galleries, or relax with a cup of coffee while taking in the ocean views.The road is also the world's largest war memorial, created for Australian soldiers who died in World War I, with a memorial arch at its eastern end.Construction of the Great Ocean Road started in 1919 to improve access to the area and create jobs for returning soldiers.

So he gave the 70-year-old pot to one of Marie's grandchildren.That's a long life for one pot!However, while experts say some old pots and pans made from carbon steel or cast iron can last for many years, we shouldn't try to get the same life out of our modern ones.According to kitchen equipment company De Buyer, cheaper nonstick pots and pans might only last two years. Better ones may last five years or more, but when the nonstick coating begins to peel away, it's time to get new ones.The Southern Living website adds that as soon as these sorts of pans get scratches or chips, bits of the pan can get into your food.The same is true for ceramic pots and pans, which can easily chip, and may last less than five years, according to De Buyer.But what about other things in your kitchen?Well, one thing many people keep too long is their washing sponge.Biology expert Elizabeth Scott told CNBC that it's not a bad idea to change your sponge every day. However, if you don't want to change it that often, make sure you only use it to wash your pots and dishes — not other parts of the kitchen.Be sure to use hot water and soap, Scott says, and even then you should change the sponge every week or two!","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.How old are your pots and pans?2.Would you use a 70-year-old pot if it was still in good shape?3.When was the last time you bought new kitchen utensils?4.Do you have any kitchen appliances you'd like to replace?5.Do you own any items that have been in your family for a long time?","Exercise 4Further Discussion Have a discussion based on the following questions.1.Do you enjoy cooking or do you see it more as a chore?2.What are some of your favorite dishes to make?3.Do you tend to make a mess when you cook?4.Who are the best cooks you know?5.Is there anything you'd like to change about your kitchen?"

This era includes many difficult times — including the rebuilding of the country after World War II — but a lot of people feel nostalgia for it, especially for the time from the 1950s onward.And there are many places around Japan where people can still get a taste of Showa-era life.For example, while Tokyo's Odaiba neighborhood might be very modern, it's also home to the new Odaiba Retro Museum. The museum replaces an older ""retro"" floor in the Decks Tokyo Beach building, and visitors to the museum can walk around spaces made to look like rooms in real Showa-era buildings, including schools, shops and homes.But a museum isn't the only place to find Showa-era Tokyo.You might also visit Nakano Broadway — a luxury shopping mall built in 1966 that's now a great place to buy vintage toys and manga. Or you could go to the famous bars of Shinjuku's Golden Gai area, which look a lot like they did many decades ago.Of course, you can see Showa-era Japan outside of Tokyo too.The Showa Era Lifestyle Museum in Kitanagoya is full of things used in everyday life during the Showa era. These include furniture, televisions, toys, candy boxes and anything else you might find in a home or town back then.And with its bright lights and colorful streets, Shinsekai in Osaka is famous for its postwar Showa-era atmosphere.If you want to go further back in time, you could even enjoy a meal in a recreation of an early Showa-era street.

There are over 120 kilometers of hiking trails along the coast.The villages are all in Cinque Terre National Park. They were connected by an 11-kilometer-long trail called Sentiero Azzurro — the Blue Trail — but after storms and landslides in the area, some sections of the trail are now closed. Tourists can still hike it between Corniglia, Vernazza and Monterosso, however.When not hiking, visitors can enjoy the water by kayaking, scuba diving or taking a boat tour.The summer months have the best weather, but also the biggest crowds, and hotels can be fully booked between April and October. In winter, it's the opposite — many hotels and restaurants close completely as rain closes the hiking trails.The villages are close together, so you can visit them all in just three to four days. This also means you don't need to stay in each village. You can book a hotel in one, and then just travel to the others.However, cars are banned inside the villages, and the roads between them may be closed on busy days.

Well, one of the biggest trends in travel right now is ""noctourism"" — travel experiences that take place at night.The word comes from ""nocturnal"" and ""tourism,"" and the night sky is a big attraction for many travelers. A 2024 survey of 27,000 people by Booking.com found that 62% were thinking about visiting places with darker skies for ""starbathing"" experiences.There are some things you can only see at night, such as the aurora borealis, better known as the northern lights. And 2025 is expected to be a great year to see them, since increased solar activity will make them stronger and brighter than usual.Some of the best places to see the northern lights include countries like Iceland, Norway and Finland, and other far-north regions like Alaska.The natural world offers lots of other nighttime experiences. For example, bioluminescent beaches light up at night with the help of glowing sea creatures. These could be plankton in places like Jervis Bay in Australia, or firefly squid in Toyama Bay, Japan.A night safari can be a fun choice too, since many interesting animals are nocturnal. In Kruger National Park in South Africa, for example, animals like lions, leopards and hyenas are much more likely to be found moving around at night.The night offers a new view of cities too. Paris is called the City of Light for how it's illuminated after dark — even the Eiffel Tower has a light show!And for those looking for art after dark, Paris takes part in the yearly European Night of Museums.

The announcements also are supposed to remind passengers to let the people sitting in the rows ahead of them exit first.The new rules took effect earlier this month, but there have been no reports yet about people getting fined.Airlines, aviation regulators and safety organizations have long spoken about the importance of remaining seated with a seat belt on while a plane is moving, to avoid injuries from things like turbulence or things falling from the overhead compartments.Many countries have regulations to stop unruly behavior on flights, and most have regulations requiring people to follow instructions for when to keep their seat belts on.In the US, for example, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations require passengers to have their seat belts on during takeoff and landing, as well as when the plane is moving or when instructed by airline staff.A failure to follow safety instructions can result in a penalty.

Traveldream looked like a trustworthy business, with a professional-looking website.But Traveldream hadn't been accredited with the Australian Travel Industry Association (ATIA) since 2020.This meant customers who booked through the site were taking a bigger risk than they realized, and most didn't find out until it was too late.After Traveldream's collapse, the ATIA shared advice to help others avoid the same trouble.""You should always check the accreditation status of a business before booking,"" it posted on social media.To check if a travel company is accredited, you can look for an official travel organization or government website in the country where the company is based.

But don't just trust the logo — it's best to check the information on the official website to make sure it's real!As well as checking accreditations, experts say you shouldn't trust a company just because its website looks legitimate or professional.

It was almost impossible to visit until bridges and ladders were added in the 1990s.WildlifeBecause it's 400 kilometers from the rest of Africa, many of the plants and animals in Madagascar cannot be found anywhere else.Although there are no monkeys on the island, Madagascar is home to more than 100 types of lemur, as well as the world's smallest reptile — called Brookesia nana — that measures just 2.2 centimetres in length when fully grown.","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What did you know about Madagascar before reading this article?2.Have you been to any natural areas you would describe as untouched?3.What are the most interesting or impressive trees you've ever seen?4.What countries do you want to visit for their wildlife? 5.What UNESCO World Heritage sites do you want to visit someday?","Exercise 4Further Discussion Have a discussion based on the following questions.1.What island nations would you like to visit someday? 2.What places in your country are known for their natural beauty? 3.Is your country famous for any plant or tree species?4.Is your country home to many animals that aren't found anywhere else?5.What attractions or experiences would you recommend to someone visiting your country for the first time?"

Earlier this year, Tokyo was ranked one of the world's most affordable travel destinations in the UK Post Office's Holiday Money Report.And it's not just Tokyo. There are many affordable destinations around Japan — and JR Pass has ranked them.JR Pass — a company that sells rail passes for traveling around Japan — looked at 18 cities around Japan and ranked them based on affordability factors like transport, accommodation, and food and drink.Known for its temples and world-famous deer, Nara came out on top for affordability. In its own reporting on the list,  TimeOut noted that the average cost of dinner in Nara is 2,878 yen — or about $20 — and the average cost of a night in a hotel is 11,600 yen — or about $80.Many visitors to Nara spend a night or two there, but it's also possible to do day trips from larger cities like Kyoto and Osaka.Next on JR Pass' list is Chiba, a city to the east of Tokyo. Chiba is well known for big events like the Summer Sonic music festival and the Tokyo Game Show.Kumamoto, on the southern island of Kyushu, came in third for affordability, followed by the city of Okinawa — found on the island of the same name — and Hiroshima.But although it's an affordable city compared to other world cities, Tokyo didn't make JR Pass' top 10 rankings. TimeOut said this list could offer some inspiration for visiting what it calls ""underrated cities"" that are perhaps less crowded than Japan's larger cities.","Exercise 3QuestionsAnswer the following questions about the article.1.How many international visitors did Japan have in 2024?2.How much is the average cost of dinner in Nara?3.What events is Chiba known for?","Exercise 4DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on JR Pass' rankings? 2.Have you visited any of the cities mentioned in the article?3.Would you say your town or city is an affordable place to visit?4.What parts of your country would you say are underrated? 5.Do you prefer visiting popular cities or less crowded places when you travel?"

Crossing items off the list during the week before you go will help you feel prepared and reduce your travel anxiety.Stay comfortableNoise-canceling headphones can help block out annoyances during travel, but if you use them, keep an eye on display boards or your phone for flight or gate changes.Carry extra medications, a change of clothes, a toothbrush and a phone-charging cable. And bringing some snacks or a sandwich from home can be both comforting and cheaper than pricey airport offerings.Stay hydratedTo counter the dry air on flights, bring along an empty water bottle (fill it after you go through security) and a small pouch with lip balm and travel-size moisturizers.Know the rulesEvery airline has different requirements when it comes to the boarding process so it's best to understand these before getting to the airport to avoid unpleasant surprises.Having your airline's app will let you know about gate changes, flight delays or cancellations sooner and allow you to more quickly find alternative flights or connections if needed.Give yourself extra timeSecurity lines can be much longer and slower than expected, and so can the walk through a large airport. So give yourself plenty of extra time by arriving at the airport two hours before departure for domestic flights and three hours before international flights.If you're too early, you can always explore the airport shops or relax with a good book somewhere.Prepare to welcome yourself homeA little extra time tidying your home and making sure you have some easy-to-prepare food ready in the freezer will make for a much more welcoming return.Wash the sheets, take out the trash, put away clothes, clean the counters. After a long trip, getting back to a neat and tidy space is the best welcome home.","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What do you find most stressful about traveling?2.Do you ever make a list of the things to pack and do before leaving?3.What are some things you always carry with you when you fly?4.How long before your flight do you typically aim to arrive at the airport?5.Do you usually tidy up your home before going on a trip?","Exercise 4Further Discussion Have a discussion based on the following questions.1.Have you had any stressful airport experiences?2.Have you ever forgotten something important when traveling?3.How do you usually feel when you get back home from a vacation?4.Do you usually take an extra day off after a trip or go straight back to work?5.Do you have any trips planned?

Here are a few foods that you should try.PaellaPaella is one of the best known Spanish dishes. Made with rice and any mix of fish, meat and vegetables you can imagine, paella comes from Valencia in the east of Spain. The name paella comes from the traditional pan it is made in, and some of the dish's famous yellow color comes from the spice, saffron.ChurrosIf you like sweet things, you have to try churros — long Spanish donuts. Churros are usually eaten for breakfast, but can be a snack at any time of day.Some say that churros were first made by Spanish shepherds who needed something to use as bread when they were far from bakeries. But others say Portuguese sailors brought a similar snack from China called ""You Tiao"" back to Portugal and Spain.TapasWhat's the best thing to eat in Spain? Probably a little bit of everything, and that's what tapas are for. A tapa is a small plate or bowl of food, and people usually have lots of different tapas at once and share them with friends.Tapas can include cheese, meat, olives, or dishes with fish, eggs and vegetables. Patatas bravas is a popular dish on tapas menus; fried potatoes with a spicy sauce.Tapas comes from the Spanish word for “cover” or “lid.” That’s one reason why some think the first tapas were small pieces of food that people would put on top of their drinks to keep the flies out!","Exercise 3QuestionsAnswer the following questions about the article.1.What is patatas bravas?2.Are churros only eaten for breakfast?3.Where does paella come from?","Exercise 4DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.Have you tried any of the foods mentioned in the article?2.Do you know of any other Spanish foods that weren't mentioned?3.What are some common bar snacks in your country?4.Do you like olives?

You checked twice. But then you got to the hotel and saw you'd forgotten to bring a plug adapter!At that moment you probably just felt annoyed. But have you ever wondered why plug sockets around the world are different?There are actually 15 different socket types, each with its own name.The simple reason why there are so many different sockets is that countries adopted their own sockets at different times based on new research and local needs.As time passed, establishing a standardized international socket design became harder and harder because of the costs involved in adapting billions of sockets.That's still the case today.At first, most plugs had two pins, although these didn't all look the same. Plugs in the US, now known as type A, had two flat pins. But in much of Europe, the two pins were round — now known as type C.As safety standards improved, many places added a third pin to ground the socket. This meant electricity flowed to the ground if there was a problem, which helped prevent electric shocks.However, different places had different solutions for this too. The US and Japan added a third, round pin below the two flat pins, creating type B sockets. But in Europe, two metal clips were added at the top and bottom of the socket to ground it, which is now called type F.And the UK and a few other places chose to use large type G sockets, which have three fat, flat pins, with two sideways on the bottom and the ground pin vertically on top.Luckily, you won't need 15 different adapters if you travel the world, since many older electrical cables are compatible with newer sockets — but you might still want to get yourself a universal adapter!","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.Were you aware that there are 15 different socket types?2.What type of plug is used in your country?

Published by the Economist Intelligence Unit, the list ranked 173 cities across five categories: health care, education, infrastructure, stability, and culture and environment.Copenhagen got perfect scores for education, infrastructure and stability. It was one of just six cities to earn a perfect score for stability — the category with the most change in this year's rankings, and also the main reason Vienna lost its place at the top.The Austrian capital now shares second place with Zurich. It lost points in the stability category after two terror threats earlier this year — one at a train station, and another ahead of several Taylor Swift concerts, which resulted in three canceled shows.Stability also dropped across much of Europe, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.Still, Europe did well this year, with four cities in the top 10. Australia followed closely with three.

And now, a large study has found it may even help prevent depression.The study, published in Psychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences, looked at how people's eating patterns could affect rates of depression.The study was based on surveys with nearly 12,500 workers at five companies in Japan.  Most participants were men, with an average age of 42.5, and just over 30% reported symptoms of depression.Participants also reported how often they'd had 21 foods and seven drinks within the previous week. Their diets were then scored from zero to nine for how similar they were to a traditional Japanese diet, which includes foods like white rice, miso soup, soy products, cooked vegetables, fish, mushrooms, seaweed and green tea.However, the researchers also looked at a modified washoku diet that replaced white rice with whole or minimally processed grains. This diet also added fruit, raw vegetables and dairy products, while giving a point value for having less salty food.The modified diet was included because of worries that the traditional washoku diet is high in sodium and low in calcium, fruits and grain fiber.The researchers found that participants who got high scores for either diet were less likely to report symptoms of depression.Those who ate the most traditionally were 17% less likely to show signs of depression compared to those who ate the least traditionally. And those whose diets were closest to the modified traditional diet were 20% less likely to show signs of depression.The results may be due to the traditional Japanese diet being high in nutrients known to protect brain health.

But it's not about cleaning for hours or making everything perfect. It's about spending a short time — usually less than two hours — cleaning together with the people you live with.Instead of one person doing all the cleaning, städdag is about doing it together. This makes cleaning feel less like one person's job, and also prevents mess — and stress — from building up.What makes städdag special is its consistent, weekly routine. It's not a big clean — it's a quick clean that resets your home and gets you ready for the week ahead.You don't need to clean everything at once, either. Many people choose to clean the most-used areas such as the kitchen or bathroom.The idea of städdag has become so popular that people are sharing their routines online. On TikTok, videos show people sharing their städdag music playlists, cleaning together, and taking a fika break when they're done. In Sweden, fika is a cozy coffee break, often with something sweet.If you want to try städdag, start by picking a time that works for everyone. In Sweden, it usually takes place on a Saturday, but the important thing is to be consistent and make it a habit.Then, set a timer and give everyone tasks so they know what to do. Play music to keep it fun, and when you're done, give yourself a treat like a snack.Do this every week, and soon it will become a habit.

But could your whole day's diet also affect how well you rest?Well, a new study from the University of Tsukuba in Japan has found that what we eat may affect how we sleep. Different nutrients, such as proteins, carbohydrates, fats and fiber, might improve or worsen our sleep quality, suggesting that changing our diet could be a way to sleep better.The study looked at the diets and sleep patterns of almost 5,000 people. The data was gathered by asking participants to use two apps — Asken, where users record what they ate during the day, and Pokémon Sleep, which records sleep habits.The researchers looked at the participants' sleep duration, how long it took to fall asleep, and how often they woke up at night. Then, they compared this information with what people were eating.The study found that people who ate more protein slept about 10 minutes longer than those who ate less. On the other hand, people who ate more fats slept for a shorter time and woke up more often at night.Those with a diet high in carbohydrates were less likely to wake up during the night, while people having more fiber fell asleep faster and slept longer. And a diet high in sodium — from salty foods — and low in potassium — found in fruits and vegetables — was linked with poorer sleep.Of course, the study isn't perfect. It doesn't prove that diet directly causes these changes.  And some factors, such as how much alcohol people drink or their stress levels, weren't included.

You keep looking at the time, hoping it's almost over. But in fact, very little time has passed.According to new research, you may not be imagining it — difficult exercise sessions may actually affect how we perceive time.In a study by researchers in the UK and the Netherlands, 33 active adults did three 4-kilometer trials on an exercise bike. In the first trial, they cycled alone; in the second, they cycled with an avatar on the bike screen; and in the third, they raced against a virtual opponent.Before each trial, they were given a time perception task where they had to estimate when 30 seconds had passed. They were given the same task at different points during the trials, and again at the end.The results showed that, when given the task during the trial, participants overestimated how long they were cycling by about 10% — meaning they felt like they were cycling for longer than they really were. The effect was the same even when participants had to race against an opponent.So why does this happen?""Exercise, particularly hard exercise, increases focus on the body, creating a heightened awareness of each moment,"" Andrew Edwards, one of the researchers, told The Guardian.Think about when you're doing something you enjoy — it feels like the time passes quickly. Here, the opposite is true: doing something you don't enjoy could make time feel like it's passing slowly.So, if you don't enjoy long sessions at the gym, the researchers say you could try finding ways to make exercise more enjoyable.

But many others don't have any idea whether their cholesterol is high or low.Experts say we need to be aware of our cholesterol levels. Cholesterol is a fatty substance made by the liver and found in food. And a high level of cholesterol in the blood can lead to blocked arteries and increase the risk of heart disease.Exercise and diet can help to lower cholesterol levels. But which foods are really good at that job?Heart UK, a cholesterol charity in Britain, suggests swapping saturated fats for unsaturated ones. That might mean eating less fatty meat and more oily fish, as well as using vegetable oils to cook instead of butter.In the US, Harvard Health recommends choosing foods that are high in soluble fiber, such as oats, beans, barley and whole grains.Harvard Health says soluble fiber binds cholesterol in the digestive system, and drags it out of the body before it gets to the blood.This also makes fruits and vegetables a great choice. Harvard Health highlights the benefits of eggplant — known as aubergine in the UK — and okra.The British Heart Foundation adds that people shouldn't forget about frozen, canned and dried fruits and vegetables.Of course, it's not just important to eat healthy meals — unhealthy snacks in between meals can also cause our cholesterol levels to rise.Experts suggest trading cakes and cookies for nuts and seeds.However, there are also some snack foods that are fortified with things called plant sterols and stanols. These help block the body from absorbing cholesterol, and they're often added to spreads and granola bars.According to Harvard, getting 2 grams per day of plant sterols or stanols can lower cholesterol by 10%.There are also supplements available in health food stores that can help to lower cholesterol.But if you're not sure what changes to make to your diet — if any — it's best to talk to your doctor!","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.Do you often think about your cholesterol levels when shopping for food or preparing meals?2.Do you usually cook with butter or oil?

Stress can affect your body, and has been connected to things like high blood pressure and even back pain.So if you lose your job, the most important thing is make sure your worries about work and money don't hurt your health.Remember: this is temporary.Keeping up your social life will give you emotional support: Anvari-Clark recommends reaching out to friends and family to help you cope.And while you should look for new work, you should also spend time networking — reaching out to former colleagues, joining professional groups and going to events connected to your career.Anvari-Clark also suggests volunteering — you could gain new skills while expanding your network, which could help you find that next job.You might also want to consider starting a side job to make a little money and give you a sense of control over your life.Don't forget to exercise, which reduces stress.

Dominic King, a sports doctor at the Cleveland Clinic, told CNN that these workouts warm the muscles, which can help you avoid injuries. Heated workouts may also help you burn more calories, because they make your heart work a bit harder.But before you turn the heat up, it's not all good news.For one thing, your body might not be able to work as hard in high heat as it can in cooler temperatures, meaning your workout won't be as good as you might like.There are also health risks to exercising in high temperatures. Because the body sweats more, it's easy to get dehydrated. Sweating also means losing important salts, so you may get cramps in your muscles or stomach.The biggest risk of exercising in heat is heatstroke. This is when the body's temperature goes above 40 degrees Celsius, which can cause serious damage to different parts of your body, and even death.If you do want to try heated exercise, there are ways to make it safer.MedlinePlus says to drink lots of water to stop you from getting dehydrated.

And for many people, becoming a little more forgetful is a normal part of getting older.There are, however, things you can do to help keep your mind and memory sharp.Feed your brainTo keep your brain in good condition, eat plenty of fruit, vegetables, whole grains and lean proteins. Lean proteins are proteins that are low in fat — things like chicken breast, white fish, beans and tofu. Omega-3 fats are also important for brain health, and you can find these in walnuts and fatty fish like salmon, tuna and sardines.Exercise your bodyPhysical activity increases blood flow, which can actually cause growth in the parts of the brain that are most important for memory. Experts recommend at least 150 minutes a week of light aerobic exercise like walking, or 75 minutes of more difficult exercise like jogging.Exercise your mindMental exercise will keep your brain in good condition. Do puzzles, play games like chess, and challenge your mind with something new. Or take up a new hobby like art, music, sports or dance — or language classes!SocializeSpending time with friends and family is also good for your memory. Research has shown that people with active social lives are less likely to suffer from memory loss. If you're spending too much time alone, join a club or volunteer group, or even keep a pet.SleepIf you don't get enough sleep, your brain can't properly process your memories. Experts recommend 7-9 hours of sleep a night.Manage your healthMany health problems can affect your memory, so follow the advice of your doctor to look after your general health.And if you're worried that memory loss is affecting your ability to do your normal activities, be sure to talk to a doctor as well.","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on the tips in the article? 2.How do you like to exercise your mind?3.Do you usually manage to get 150 minutes of light exercise each week?4.Do you find it surprising that a good diet is linked to better memory?5.Why do you think it's harder to maintain an active social life as we age?","Exercise 4Further Discussion Have a discussion based on the following questions.1.Do you have a good memory?2.Who are the most forgetful people you know?3.Do you know many older people whose minds are still very sharp? 4.What do you think are the best ways to slow cognitive decline?5.In your opinion, what's the key to living a long and healthy life?"

It May Be 'Sunset Anxiety'If you start to feel worried or sad as the sun goes down, you may be experiencing something called ""sunset anxiety.""""Sunset anxiety"" isn't an official medical term.  But many mental health experts agree that some people feel more anxious when the sun goes down. And people may be more likely to experience sunset anxiety during the shorter days of winter when there's less sunlight.This may be because the shorter days make us feel like there isn't enough time to finish all of our daily goals. So when the sun goes down some people may feel guilty about not getting enough done during the day.Others may feel regret, because their work during the day prevented them from enjoying the shorter daylight hours.Sunset anxiety may also be connected to the body's internal clock. This clock regulates the physical and mental processes that a body goes through in a 24-hour day, telling us when to sleep and wake up, and when to get hungry, for example.This clock is affected by light and dark, so when it gets darker earlier, it can have a negative effect on your mood.There are some things you can do if you're experiencing sunset anxiety.Most experts agree that it's a good idea to get outside and get some natural light during the day. This should help your body clock and improve your mood. And if you can't get enough sunlight, use a sun lamp that mimics natural light.Speaking to Fox News, psychologist Andrea D. Guastello also recommended getting enough sleep, eating well and getting regular exercise. However, she said that people shouldn't exercise within two hours of their bedtime.Guastello also recommended doing something enjoyable around the time you usually feel anxious.However, if these tips don't help, or you find that sunset anxiety is making your life difficult, experts say you should talk to a mental health professional.","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.Had you heard of sunset anxiety before reading this article?2.Have you ever experienced sunset anxiety? 3.Do you find it harder to get things done in the winter?4.What times does the sun set in the winter months where you live?5.Is there a large difference between summer and winter daylight hours where you live?","Exercise 4Further Discussion Have a discussion based on the following questions.1.Do you spend much time outside in winter?2.What are some of your favorite wintertime activities?3.What time of year is the most pleasant where you live?4.What's your favorite season?

They also have a 22% increased risk of depression.Ultra-processed foods usually have more than one ingredient or additive that you are unlikely to find in a normal kitchen, whether to add flavor or to act as preservatives. They also often have a lot of salt, sugar and saturated fat. For example, most instant noodles, hot dogs and potato chips are ultra-processed foods.Another study by a British and Dutch team published in Nutritional Neuroscience in 2024 looked at how a poor diet affects the brain. Researchers looked at the diets of 30 participants and examined scans of their brains.The study found that participants with a bad diet had reduced grey matter volume in the frontal areas of their brain and an imbalance of certain chemicals, all of which are associated with common mental health issues.The good news is, if a poor diet can harm your mental health, a good diet might protect it, especially the Mediterranean diet. The Mediterranean diet is known for its focus on fresh vegetables, fruit, fish and olive oil, and it doesn't include a lot of ultra-processed foods.A recent review of 13 studies found that the Mediterranean diet may reduce the risks of depression and anxiety among children and teenagers.And a 20-year study of Swedish women aged 29 to 49 also found that sticking to a Mediterranean diet was associated with a reduced risk of depression later in life.","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on the findings of these studies?2.Do you find it surprising that ultra-processed foods might increase the risk of anxiety and depression?3.How often do you eat ultra-processed foods?

It helps the cells stay healthy and work better.Apoptosis is when cells shut down and die when they are no longer useful, or are too badly damaged. This is normal, but it isn't good if it's happening too much.The researchers found that at the start of the week, the participants' cells were having a hard time. The autophagy process wasn't working as it should have been, and there was a little too much cell death.But by the end of the week, the autophagy process had gotten better and the cells weren't shutting down and dying — they were repairing themselves more instead.Kelli King, who was one of the researchers, said she was amazed at how quickly the cells had adapted to the cold baths.She said this shows that spending time in cold water could perhaps be used to help cells stay healthy for longer, and even prevent diseases.However, experts say people should always speak to their doctor before spending time in cold water!","Exercise 3QuestionsAnswer the following questions about the article.1.What temperature was the water that study participants spent time in?2.What is apoptosis? 3.Was Kelli King surprised by the study results?","Exercise 4DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on the findings of this study?2.Do you ever take cold baths or showers?3.What's the coldest water you've been in?

But many of those studies couldn't prove if pets caused those good effects, or if happier people were just more likely to get pets.To find out, the researchers looked at data from 2,500 households in the UK — specifically those who owned cats and dogs.The researchers used survey data that included information about each person's personality, which helped them check if some personality types were more likely to have pets and also feel happier.But even taking personality into account, the results showed that having a pet made people feel three to four points happier on a seven-point scale.Putting a dollar value on this happiness, the researchers found that owning a pet could bring the same level of life satisfaction as having an extra $90,000 a year.

People also credit it with helping them lose weight or give up smoking.So how does it actually work?The first thing to say is that it doesn't work for everyone, and swinging watches aren't required! Basically, the therapist uses the power of suggestion to influence the patient.People are encouraged to enter into a state of relaxation that allows them to concentrate better.For those who are susceptible, the hypnotherapist will often speak slowly and softly to help the patient relax. They might ask them to imagine they are on a beach, or somewhere else they'll feel calm.Then, when they're in a relaxed state, the therapist will make suggestions designed to improve the patient's viewpoint, whether that's related to their need to smoke or their feelings of pain.The idea is that it's easier for patients to accept guidance, criticism or suggestion when they're in this relaxed state.However, experts remind people that they are still in control of their actions.But while hypnotherapy has gained credibility over time, some medical professionals say more research is still needed.And some believe that patients and therapists should be cautious about using hypnotherapy to manage stressful events from childhood. When used in this way, experts say it could contribute to increased anxiety, or even lead to the formation of false memories.","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on hypnotherapy? 2.Do you know anyone who's tried hypnotherapy? 3.Do you find it surprising that hypnotherapy could help with physical pain?4.Do you think hypnotherapy should be considered a serious medical treatment?5.Do you know of any famous hypnotists from your country?","Exercise 4Further Discussion Have a discussion based on the following questions.1.What places come to mind when you think of somewhere calm and relaxing?2.Have you tried any relaxation techniques like meditation or deep breathing?3.Do you think everyday life is more stressful today than it was in the past? 4.What do you do to relax when you're feeling stressed?5.You are today where your thoughts have brought you; you will be tomorrow where your thoughts take you. — James Allen.

Then, researchers gave them nature-related words to imagine, such as ""mountain"" or ""forest,"" and city words, such as ""library"" or ""factory.""The researchers then measured how relaxed the students felt, and checked their bodies for signs of stress.The results were clear: when students imagined nature, they felt more relaxed. Their heart rate slowed down and their heart rate variability went up — both signs of being more relaxed.Heart rate variability is the small change in time between each heartbeat. When this number goes up, it usually means the body is calm and not feeling stressed.The study also found that people who already liked nature felt even more relaxed when imagining it.The researchers say this could be useful for therapy.

And when you don't have enough food, your immune system gets weaker, meaning your body will struggle to stay healthy and fight infections.But what if it doesn't just matter how much you've eaten — what if it also matters how much your brain thinks you've eaten?Researchers from the UK and Italy looked at the effects of two types of neurons that create feelings of hunger and fullness in response to how much energy the body has.The researchers artificially activated the hunger neurons in the brains of mice, making them feel hungry even after they had eaten. And to their surprise, they found this led to a drop in certain immune cells in the blood that help regulate inflammation.Inflammation is part of your body's response to things like germs and injuries, and it helps with healing.The researchers then activated the fullness neurons in mice that hadn't eaten, and found those immune cells returned to normal levels.In other words, when the brain thought the body was hungry or full — regardless of whether the mice had actually taken in any nutrition — it affected the number of immune cells in their blood.The researchers further found that when the hunger neurons were turned on, nutrient-sensing in the liver decreased — meaning the brain was affecting how the liver interpreted the body's energy needs.The researchers said these results challenge the idea that our bodies' immune responses are mainly the result of physical changes in our nutrition, like our blood sugar levels or nutrient intake.They also said that, if the brain is able to regulate our immune responses in this way, it may be possible to develop new ways to treat diseases just by targeting the brain.However, they also said more research is needed — especially on how this process works in humans, not just in mice.","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on the findings of this research?2.Do you find it surprising that the feeling of being hungry may affect the body's immune system?3.Have you noticed any changes in your mood or energy when you're hungry? 4.Do you ever feel hungry after eating a big meal?5.What do you usually eat when you're feeling unwell?","Exercise 4Further Discussion Have a discussion based on the following questions.1.What do you find most fascinating about the human brain?2.Would you consider taking part in a medical trial or experiment?3.Do you know any scientists?

Some claim the practice gives them access to joy, creativity and connection they can't get otherwise.Those who do it say they aren't ""tripping"" or seeing visions, and they don't do it every day. Instead, they take tiny doses intermittently, on a schedule or when they feel it could be beneficial.One small study suggests any psychological benefits come from users' expectations — the placebo effect. But the science is still new and research is still being done.The substances are illegal in most places, but scientific research focused on the benefits of supervised hallucinatory experiences has led the US states of Oregon and Colorado to legalize psychedelic therapy.Further opening the door to microdosing, a handful of US cities have officially directed police to make psychedelics a low priority for enforcement.""I started microdosing and within a couple of months, I had a general sense of well-being that I hadn't had in so long,"" said Matt Metzger, who served in the US army.Taking small amounts of psilocybin helps him cope with post-traumatic stress disorder, he said.These kinds of claims are hard to measure in the lab, say scientists.In one study involving people who microdose, participants didn't know until afterward whether they had spent four weeks taking their usual microdose or placebos. Psychological measures improved after four weeks for everyone in the study, regardless of whether they were taking microdoses or empty capsules.Few studies of psilocybin microdosing have been done, while those focusing on LSD have been inconclusive.Psilocybin mushrooms are the most popular psychedelic drug, according to a report, which estimates that 8 million people in the US used psilocybin in 2023 and half of them reported microdosing the last time they used it.But even microdosing advocates warn that the long-term effects have not been studied.","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.Had you heard of microdosing before reading the article?2.How popular do you imagine microdosing is in your country?3.What is the legal status of psychedelics in your country?4.Do you think psychedelic therapy could become the norm in the future?5.What percentage of people in your country do you imagine have taken drugs?","Exercise 4Further Discussion Have a discussion based on the following questions.1.Is drug abuse a big problem in your country?

Although some forms of arrhythmia can be harmless, others can increase the risk of having heart disease or a stroke.The new research, published in the journal Heart, looked at data from over 420,000 people in the UK who had self-reported their own walking pace. Of those, almost 82,000 also provided carefully measured data on their time spent walking at different paces over a seven-day period.The study defined three different walking paces: slow, average and brisk. A slow pace was defined as under 5 kilometers per hour; average was between 5 and 6 kilometers per hour; and brisk was over 6 kilometers per hour.Nearly 7% of participants said they had a slow pace; almost 53% said they had an average pace; and just under 41% said they had a brisk pace.Over a period of nearly 14 years, 36,574 participants — about 9% — developed some form of arrhythmia.The researchers found that an average walking pace was associated with a 35% lower risk of developing arrhythmia, while a brisk pace was associated with a 43% lower risk.The data from people who had carefully measured their walking pace also indicated that walking at an average pace for between five minutes and 15 minutes a day would be enough to reduce the risk of developing arrhythmia.Jill Pell, one of the authors of the study, told CNN, ""The great thing about walking is that it is accessible to everyone.

You don't need to start your day with dozens of activities to improve it.But she says it is a good idea to think about how you get going because having a relaxed, structured morning could help boost your energy and mood.As a professor of workplace psychology at The University of Oklahoma, Shawn McClean has spent years studying how work life is influenced by the rest of your life.His research has found that employees perform better and are more calm throughout the day when they complete their morning routine uninterrupted. But employees with disruptive mornings report higher levels of mental depletion late in the day.It's hard to define what a good routine is, and there is no one routine that is best for everyone. But some routines can do more harm than good.Rushing around in the morning to shower, eat and get out the door just on time is an example of a destructive morning routine, Kaur says.The stress of a rushed morning produces extra cortisol, which is a necessary hormone that helps regulate the circadian rhythm, she said. It's what naturally wakes you up and makes you alert in the morning.Too much cortisol in the blood, however, creates a feeling of restlessness and anxiety.People who often have hectic mornings should consider setting their alarm 30 minutes earlier, Kaur says.Then, she suggests, make your bed, get some natural light, drink water and take a walk!","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.How do you usually start your days?

Maybe you feel too embarrassed to join a yoga class or work out in front of other people at the gym.But there's one type of exercise that anyone can do, regardless of the shape they're in.Perhaps you've already heard of it.In Japan, it's called tai kyoku ken. In Korea, it's tae geuk gwon. But in Western countries, it's usually called ""tai chi chuan,"" or just ""tai chi"" for short.Tai chi was developed in central China during the 17th century as a martial art. But these days it's more commonly practiced for its health benefits than for fighting. And it has become very popular around the world.Tai chi exercise consists of gentle, flowing, circular movements accompanied by focused breathing.Because the movements of tai chi are gentle and slow, the exercise is often recommended for older people, but people of any age can do it.It's known to improve muscle strength, flexibility and balance — and, surprisingly, it has been found to burn as many calories as more strenuous exercise, and is just as effective at helping people lose weight.When people practice tai chi, they're very focused on their movements and their breathing, so sometimes it's called ""meditation in motion.""  And this element of mindfulness might be why tai chi is also good for reducing stress and anxiety.There have been many clinical studies on other possible health benefits of tai chi. Research has shown it's good for the heart, reduces blood pressure and cholesterol, boosts immunity, and improves brain function.One 2022 study in Shanghai even found that people who practice tai chi live longer!If you want to try tai chi, you might be able to find a group class in your area.

Now scientists are studying his blood in hopes of creating a better treatment for snake bites.Friede has long had a fascination with reptiles and has kept dozens of snakes at his Wisconsin home.Hoping to protect himself from snake bites — and out of what he calls ""simple curiosity"" — he began injecting himself with small doses of snake venom and then slowly increased the amount to try to build up tolerance. He would then let snakes bite him.While no doctor would say this is a good idea, experts say his method follows how the body works. An immune system exposed to small amounts of snake venom develops antibodies to neutralize the poison. A small amount of venom won't overwhelm the body. And the body can handle larger exposures if it has been exposed to the venom before.After 18 years of snake bites and injections, Friede now wants to help others. He emailed every scientist he could find, asking them to study the tolerance he'd built up.There is a need: Around 110,000 people die from snake bites every year, according to the World Health Organization. Making antivenom is expensive and difficult and most antivenoms are only effective against specific snake species.Now in the journal Cell, scientists have shared their findings from a study of Friede's unique blood. They identified two antibodies that neutralize venom from many different snake species and hope someday to produce a treatment with broad protection.It's very early research — the antivenom was only tested in mice, and researchers are still years away from human trials.Friede now works for Centivax, a company that helped pay for the study and is trying to develop the antivenom.

But the percentage of energy people got from ultra-processed foods was higher in every other country, from 17% in Brazil to 44% in Canada, 53% in the UK and 55% in America.It was also found that, for every 10% increase in the amount of energy people got from ultra-processed foods, there was a 3% higher chance of death from all causes.In fact, the researchers estimated that, in America, 124,000 early deaths each year can be linked to eating ultra-processed foods.The study's lead investigator, Eduardo Augusto Fernandes Nilson, also said that, in richer countries although consumption of ultra-processed foods has been high it hasn't really been increasing. However, it has been increasing in poorer countries. So while these foods are already linked to more deaths in richer countries, their effects on poorer countries will only get worse.The study authors say their results show that consumption of ultra-processed foods is a global health issue, and that governments should be doing more to encourage people to eat fresh and minimally processed foods.","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on the findings of this study? 2.Do you find it surprising that people in the UK and the US get more than half of their energy from ultra-processed foods?3.Do you imagine consumption of ultra-processed foods has increased in your country in recent years?4.Does your government do anything to encourage people to eat minimally processed foods?5.What ultra-processed foods do you tend to have most often?","Exercise 4Further Discussion Have a discussion based on the following questions.1.What unhealthy foods would you find the hardest to give up?2.What do you tend to eat when you're too busy to cook?3.How healthy would you say an average diet in your country is?4.Why do you think so many people find it hard to maintain a healthy diet?5.If you keep good food in your fridge, you will eat good food. — Errick McAdams.

About half of the children were from racial or ethnic minority groups, including Black, Latino, Native American and Asian American children — groups that are often underrepresented or have less social power in the US.For the study, researchers asked students to name their best friends and the classmates they thought were the most helpful.The results showed that children who had more friends of a different gender were more often seen as helpful by classmates from that gender. For example, a boy who was friends with many girls was more likely to be seen as helpful by his female classmates.The same pattern appeared with race — children who had friends from a different racial group were more likely to be seen as kind by their classmates from other racial groups.The researchers also found that children who had more friends of another gender were also more likely to be kind toward classmates of a different race.However, children with more interracial friendships were not always kinder to classmates of a different gender — unless they also had several friends of another gender.The results show that diverse friendships in school may help children become more open, kind and inclusive.Sonya Xinyue Xiao, one of the lead researchers, said the study was driven by her own personal experiences.""I was the 'new' kid during elementary school, middle school, and high school, and felt like an outsider in accounting during college,"" she told PsyPost.Xiao says she wants to continue studying how kindness and inclusive behavior develop in children.","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on the findings of this study?2.Why do you think diverse friendships might lead to more kindness?3.Did you have school friends from different racial or cultural backgrounds?4.Did you go to a mixed-gender school? 5.What do you think are the most effective ways to help kids develop kind and inclusive behavior?","Exercise 4Further Discussion Have a discussion based on the following questions.1.Who were your best friends growing up?

These people were also more physically active, and had better mental health.Meanwhile, another 2013 study, this one in Canada, looked at high school students who spent an hour a week volunteering with elementary school children.After 10 weeks, the volunteers had lower levels of inflammation and cholesterol than students who weren't volunteering. They also had lower body mass indexes. And the students who got the most benefit from volunteering were the ones who showed the greatest increase in kindness and the greatest improvement in mental health.So why does this happen?Well, we're not actually sure. But we have some good guesses.Speaking to NPR, Laura Kubzansky of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health said that volunteering and acts of kindness may help reduce stress, which is known to have a number of negative health effects, including increased blood pressure. She said doing kind things may also ""help to give you more perspective on what your own problems are.""Being more social is also linked to having fewer physical and mental health problems, especially as we get older.

Well, don't get too comfortable — it could be bad for your brain.A new study suggests that spending too much time sitting could make your brain smaller and affect your mental abilities. And this is true even if you try to make up for time spent sitting with regular exercise.Researchers from Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, studied 404 adults over a seven-year period. Participants were all aged 71 or older, and none of them suffered from dementia at the beginning of the study.For 10 days, the study participants wore devices on their wrists to measure how much time they spent sitting and how much time they were active. Participants also had their mental abilities tested and their brains scanned.These measurements, tests and scans were all done at the beginning of the study and repeated at several points during the following seven years.The researchers found that more time spent sitting was associated with a decreased ability to remember things, and less brain thickness in areas of the brain that are usually affected by Alzheimer's disease.Over time, participants who spent more time sitting also got worse at naming things and took longer to process information. They also had less volume in the hippocampus, part of the brain that helps make memories.These effects were also worse for participants who had a gene that is associated with a higher risk of Alzheimer's disease.However, most of the participants were getting at least 150 minutes of exercise each week, as recommended by health experts. This suggests that exercising won't stop the negative effects of too much sitting.The researchers suggest that health care workers who are looking after older people not only consider how much exercise they get, but also try to reduce the amount of time they spend sitting.","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on the study's findings?2.Do you find it surprising that too much sitting could affect your mental abilities?3.How much time do you imagine you spend sitting during a typical work day?4.Do you ever take breaks to move around after sitting for long periods?5.Do you spend a lot of time sitting outside of work?","Exercise 4Further Discussion Have a discussion based on the following questions.1.Are you usually more active on weekends or during the week?2.Is there anything you'd like to change about your exercise routine?3.Are there any physical activities you hope to keep doing as you get older?4.Would you say you're more active now than you were in the past? 5.Sitting is the new smoking. — James Levine.

These drugs help people lose weight by copying a hormone in the body that makes people feel full faster, so they eat less.In the study, people using these drugs lost an average of 16 kilograms. But after stopping the treatment, they gained back around 10 kilograms in just one year, meaning they would likely return to their original weight in less than two years.The researchers also looked at earlier studies on diets without drugs. They found that people who stop dieting also gain weight back, but much more slowly — usually over five years.Meanwhile, the UK's National Health Service is said to be considering offering GLP-1 drugs in pharmacies without a prescription.But the UK also only recommends using this type of weight-loss drug for up to two years, which raises concerns about whether short-term use is worth the cost if the weight comes back so quickly.Susan Jebb, one of the study's researchers, explained that the reason people regain weight more slowly on diets is that diets often teach people how to control their eating.On the other hand, weight-loss drugs just stop people from wanting to eat without actually changing any habits. So when people stop taking them, they may not know how to keep the weight off.Experts say people need more support when they stop taking the medication. This might include diet advice or group programs to help them keep the weight off in the long term.","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on the findings of this study?2.Do you find it surprising that many people regain most of the weight after stopping weight-loss drugs? 3.Do you think weight-loss drugs should be available without a prescription?4.Has anyone you know ever followed a strict weight-loss program?

According to America's National Institute of Mental Health, over a quarter of American adults experience some kind of mental health problem each year. And talking about it can help.Also called psychotherapy or counseling, talk therapy gives people an opportunity to discuss their problems with a mental health professional who will listen and help them find solutions without judging them.And according to a new study at Columbia University in New York, talk therapy is becoming more popular among Americans looking for mental health treatment.The study, published in The American Journal of Psychiatry, also found that fewer people were relying on medication for their mental health problems.The research team looked at data from four surveys of Americans, covering 18,000 people who had received mental health care.The researchers found that between 2018 and 2021, the percentage of people relying on talk therapy alone for outpatient mental health care increased from 12% to 15%.The study also found that more people were successfully continuing their talk therapy after starting it, with over 17% in 2021 saying they went to more than 20 sessions, compared to less than 14% in 2018.And the number of people who stopped talk therapy after one or two sessions fell from 34% in 2018 to 28% in 2021.Speaking to NPR, Jessi Gold of the University of Tennessee — who was not involved with the study — said this change might be because people are now more aware of talk therapy and what to expect from it.She said the coronavirus pandemic may also have made people more open to talking about their feelings.","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on the findings by Columbia University? 2.Has talk therapy become more popular in your country in recent years?3.How have attitudes toward therapy changed where you live over the years?4.Do you think the pandemic has changed how people view mental health?5.Could you see yourself working as a therapist or counselor?","Exercise 4Further Discussion Have a discussion based on the following questions.1.Are mental health services easily accessible where you live? 2.Would you say everyday life is more stressful today than it was in the past?3.Who do you usually talk to when you're feeling stressed or overwhelmed?4.How do you expect mental health treatment to change in the coming decades?5.Talk to yourself like you would to someone you love. — Brené Brown.

But such reports are known to be unreliable because people don't remember everything they ate, or they don't record their diets accurately.In this study, Loftfield and her colleagues examined existing data of more than 1,000 older US adults. More than 700 of them had provided blood and urine samples, as well as detailed dietary recall reports, collected over a year.The scientists found that hundreds of metabolites — products of digestion and other processes — corresponded to the percentage of energy a person consumes from ultra-processed foods.From those, they devised a system using 28 blood markers and up to 33 urine markers that reliably predicted ultra-processed food intake in people consuming typical diets.It's still early research, but identifying blood and urine markers to predict consumption of ultra-processed foods is ""a major scientific advance,"" said Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian from Tufts University, who was not involved in the study.Loftfield said she hopes to apply the tool to existing studies where blood and urine samples are available to track, for instance, the effect of consuming ultra-processed foods on cancer risk.However, at a time when support for government research is being cut, funding remains uncertain.","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on this discovery?2.How often do you eat ultra-processed food?

Commit and start smallThe first step to success is to commit to eating less meat. Tell your friends and family what you plan to do, as this will help you stick to your goal. Then start small. Try not eating meat on Mondays or on weekends, for example. Or stop eating beef and pork, but continue eating chicken and fish.2.

For example, maybe you want to lose weight, help the environment or save money. Having more than one goal in mind will help you stick to your decision to eat less meat.3. Plan your mealsIt can be hard to know what to cook when you start eating less meat, since you might not be able to make your old favorites. This is why it's a good idea to plan your meals each week.Planning will also help you avoid eating the same meals over and over again, which will get boring and make it very hard to stick to your goals.4.

If it's not too oily or dry, it's ""normal"" skin.You might also have areas of your skin that are very dry while others are very oily. That means you have ""combination"" skin.If your skin easily gets red or uncomfortable, you have ""sensitive"" skin.Knowing your skin type will help you choose the right products for it. When you find those, a simple routine is: cleanse, tone, treat, moisturize, protect.You should cleanse — or wash — your face every morning and evening. You may want to double-cleanse in the evening to make sure you take off any makeup or sunscreen you wore. This means first using an oil-based cleanser before using your normal face wash.A toner can then get any last dirt off your face and get it ready for other products. At this point you can use products like serums and eye creams for treating specific problems.Next comes moisturizer, which will hydrate your skin and keep it healthy. People with oily skin should use a light, water-based moisturizer, while those with dry skin may need something heavier.Finally, your morning skincare routine should include sunscreen. Using it will protect your skin from sun damage, which can cause skin cancer. You need half a teaspoon for your face and neck, and should put more on during the day.","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What's your skincare routine like? Do you think you should change it?2.What are your favorite skincare products? 3.Do you find it difficult to know what products are best for your skin?4.Do you like trying new cosmetic products or do you tend to use the same ones?5.Do you wear sunscreen on your face every day?","Exercise 4Further Discussion Have a discussion based on the following questions.1.Where do you get most of your skincare or beauty advice?2.Do you follow any skincare or beauty influencers?3.Do you know anyone who spends a lot of time or money on skincare?4.Have you ever had a professional skincare treatment?

Have a Cup of Tea!A new study has found that tea and certain foods like dark chocolate, apples and grapes may be as effective as medications for lowering high blood pressure.A team of international researchers wanted to examine the effectiveness of certain compounds called flavan-3-ols for improving blood pressure and blood vessel function. These compounds can be found in tea, cocoa and some fruits.The team looked at the results of 145 trials published between 1946 and 2024 that studied the effectiveness of flavan-3-ol-rich foods, drinks and supplements. Altogether, over 5,000 people took part in these trials.The trials varied in type from single doses taken to measure immediate effects to daily consumption for as long as 26 weeks.  The participants included both healthy people and those with a variety of health problems.The researchers found that daily consumption of flavan-3-ol-rich foods and drinks was associated with a significant decrease in blood pressure — which was in some cases as effective as taking medications.However, these foods and drinks were most effective for people who already had high blood pressure, while people who already had normal blood pressure saw little change.The researchers also found that taking supplements containing isolated flavan-3-ol compounds was not as effective as eating foods or drinks that naturally contain them.The data also showed that having flavan-3-ol-rich foods and drinks was associated with improved blood vessel function, which suggests that such foods could be used to help maintain cardiovascular health.Christian Heiss, one of the authors of the study, said that incorporating ""small amounts of commonly consumed foods like tea, apples, dark chocolate, or cocoa powder"" to your diet could provide enough flavan-3-ols and be an enjoyable way to support your health.""While not a replacement for prescribed medications or medical advice, including more flavan-3-ol-rich foods in a daily routine could be a valuable addition to a healthy lifestyle, especially for those with higher blood pressure,"" he added.","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on the study's findings? 2.Do you find it surprising that things like tea and dark chocolate may be effective for lowering high blood pressure? 3.How often do you have tea, dark chocolate or apples?4.Is high blood pressure a major health concern in your country?5.Have you taken any steps to improve your cardiovascular health?","Exercise 4Further Discussion Have a discussion based on the following questions.1.Are there any foods you eat or avoid for health reasons?2.Have you made any big changes to your diet over the years? 3.Do you tend to read nutritional labels when buying food or drinks?4.What foods do you think everyone should eat more of?5.Which of your friends or family has the healthiest lifestyle?"

There's even a special term for it: middle-age spread. But although losing that middle-age spread takes some effort, new research suggests that it could make your later life much healthier, and even help you live longer.According to a study published in JAMA Network Open, middle-aged people who lose about 6.5% of their body weight, and who manage to keep their weight down without using any special medicine or surgery, have a much reduced risk of developing chronic diseases, and they are more likely to live longer.The research team from Finland and the UK looked at data from previous studies that had followed three groups of people over three different time periods: 1964 to 1973, 1985 to 1988, and 2000 to 2013. Altogether there were over 23,000 participants.The researchers grouped these participants according to their weight at the beginning of the study period and whether they gained, lost or kept that weight. They then looked at their health and death records.They found that participants who lost weight in middle age by either changing their diet or exercising were less likely to have serious health problems in later life. They had a much-reduced risk of having heart attacks, strokes, cancer, asthma and lung disease, and they were also less likely to die from any cause over a 35-year follow-up period.The study is significant because, although previous research has shown that lifestyle changes resulting in a healthier weight can reduce the risk of developing diabetes, the long-term effects on other possible health problems have been unclear.The study authors said that although losing middle-age spread and keeping a healthy weight without using special medicines or surgery is challenging, their findings show it is possible — and ""the best option for overall health.""","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on the study's findings? 2.Do you find it surprising that losing weight in middle age could lead to a healthier and longer life? 3.Do you know anyone who made major lifestyle changes later in life? 4.Would you say it's easier to change your diet or exercise routine? 5.In your opinion, what's the most effective way to lose weight?","Exercise 4Further Discussion Have a discussion based on the following questions.1.What changes have you made to your lifestyle over the years? 2.What's the best diet advice you've come across?3.Would you describe the average diet in your country as healthy?4.What foods do you think everyone should eat more of?5.Which of your friends or family leads the healthiest lifestyle?"

It's believed that the caffeine in coffee helps us wake up and gives us energy for the day. However, a study has found that decaffeinated coffee might have some of the same effects as normal coffee!Researchers worked with 20 students from Slovenian universities. All were healthy, in their early 20s, and regular coffee drinkers, having one to three cups a day.The participants didn't drink coffee for at least eight hours before the research experiment, and got at least seven hours of sleep before it began. They had their general health checked, as well as their blood pressure and heart rate.Everyone was given a cup of coffee that looked and tasted exactly the same. In fact, all of the coffee was decaffeinated, but half of the cups had 6 milligrams of caffeine added to them. But all of the participants believed they were drinking caffeine.After 20 minutes, the participants did tests to see how their brains and bodies were working after the coffee. The researchers' hypothesis was that if caffeine was the reason coffee gives us energy, the participants who drank it would see a greater effect.But that's not what they found. Instead, both groups showed similar physical changes, with decreased heart rates and increased blood pressure.Taking a mental arithmetic task after drinking either the decaf or caffeinated coffee didn't show any particular changes in performances compared to tests done before drinking the coffee. But both groups actually did better in an auditory attention test, although those who had caffeine did see a more significant improvement.The researchers said this suggests that caffeine helps how quickly we process auditory information, but there may be a placebo effect, since those who only believed they were drinking regular coffee improved too.","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on the study's findings? 2.Are you a big coffee drinker?

As long as we get some rest after, we're usually fine.But what if we have to work extra hours all the time?Well, chronic overwork will affect our health. It has been found to increase the risk of high blood pressure, heart disease, poor sleep, depression and anxiety, as well as making us more prone to injury.A 2009 study even found that British civil servants who worked more than 55 hours per week had lower scores on vocabulary tests, and were poorer at reasoning.And now, a new study from South Korea suggests that chronic overwork could even change the structure of our brains, especially the parts associated with cognition and emotion.The South Korean study used the MRI data of 110 people. Most of them were health care workers, with 32 working 52 hours a week or more, and the other 78 working fewer hours. The researchers noted that participants in the ""overworked"" group were generally younger and more highly educated, and hadn't been in their careers for as long.An analysis of both groups found that overworked participants showed significant changes in regions of the brain associated with executive function and emotional regulation. For example, they had a 19% increase in the volume of the middle frontal gyrus, which is a part of the brain associated with attention, memory and language.Overworked participants also showed an increase in volume of the insula, which is involved in emotional processing, self awareness and social skills. Other areas with increased volume included those linked with planning and decision making.The researchers said they don't yet have enough data to make a firm conclusion about cause and effect, but the results are an important first step to understanding the relationship between overwork and the structure of the brain.They said, ""The observed changes in brain volume may provide a biological basis for the cognitive and emotional challenges often reported in overworked individuals.""","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on the findings of this study?2.Do you find it surprising that overwork can change the structure of our brains?3.How often do you have to work extra hours? 4.Do you imagine many people in your industry are overworked? 5.What would you say is the most hours you've worked in a week?","Exercise 4Further Discussion Have a discussion based on the following questions.1.Which of your friends or family has the most stressful job? 2.What do you usually do to recover after a busy or stressful week at work?3.What kind of jobs do you think allow for a good work-life balance?4.What would your ideal work schedule look like? 5.Overworking is the Black Plague of the 21st Century. — Richie Norton.

It found that women who drank caffeinated coffee in midlife were more likely to show signs of healthy aging.The study was based on data collected since 1984. The researchers looked at questionnaires that asked how often participants had caffeinated drinks like coffee, tea and cola, as well as decaffeinated coffee.""Healthy aging"" was defined in the study as living to age 70 or older, being free from 11 chronic diseases, staying physically fit, having good mental health, and showing no signs of cognitive issues or memory problems.Following the data for 30 years, the researchers estimated how the women's chances of healthy aging changed with every 80 milligrams of caffeine they had per day. The researchers also took into account other things that can affect health, like body weight, smoking, alcohol use, diet, exercise, and even education level.By 2016, around 3,700 women in the study had met all the criteria for healthy aging. From ages 45 to 60, these women had an average of 315 milligrams of caffeine per day. That's about as much caffeine as you get from three small cups of coffee. The researchers also noted that 80% of that caffeine did indeed come from drinking regular, caffeinated coffee.Things looked even better for women who drank more coffee. There was a 2% to 5%  increased chance of doing well later in life per extra cup for those who drank up to five cups of coffee a day.The same links with healthy aging weren't found with drinking decaffeinated coffee or tea — and the researchers also noted that, despite containing caffeine, drinking more cola was associated with a lower chance of healthy aging.","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on the study's findings?2.Do you find it surprising that coffee could help women age more healthily?3.Have your coffee drinking habits changed over the years?4.How often do you drink caffeinated drinks besides coffee?5.Do you know anyone who drinks more than five cups of coffee a day?","Exercise 4Further Discussion Have a discussion based on the following questions.1.Who are the healthiest elderly people you know? 2.How has your view of aging changed over the years?3.What would you like your life to look like when you're 70 or older?4.Do you think aging healthily is easier or harder today than it was in the past?5.What do you think is the secret to living a long and healthy life?"

Pets have been shown to lower their humans' stress levels, get them to exercise and more. Many pet owners also say they feel a great amount of comfort by having their pets close as they sleep.But dogs' and cats' sleep cycles aren't the same as those of humans.Dogs are light sleepers and wake up several times at night. Some also have instinctual behaviors like scratching at bedding, which can prevent deeper phases of sleep even if it doesn't wake you up.And cats evolved to hunt in low light, meaning they are more active before the sun comes up and after it goes down — as many cat owners who have experienced their cat's ""zoomies"" will tell you!Milanak also said allergens such as microbes brought into the house can affect owners' breathing, preventing them from getting enough deep sleep.But many pet owners feel that small disturbances are worth it for the comfort of having their pet close to them.So if you really want your pet near you when you sleep, Milanak says you should wash the sheets more often and perhaps make small changes to your sleep schedule to match your pet's routine.

They should sip water slowly, and fan themselves or pour cold water on their skin. They should also get medical help.If heat exhaustion isn't treated properly, it can easily become heatstroke, which is much more serious.Heatstroke is when the body can no longer control its temperature, which then gets too high. People with heatstroke may be confused, have slurred speech, have seizures, or fall unconscious. Without emergency medical treatment, they could even die.If someone has heatstroke, they should be taken out of the heat and cooled down. But if they can't drink on their own, don't try to make them drink, as they could breathe in the drink, which is dangerous.There are things you can do to avoid developing heat exhaustion or heatstroke.For one thing, drink more cold drinks on very hot days. You can carry a bottle of water with you, or drink sports drinks — they'll help your body replace its salts. Salt candies can also help. But avoid drinking alcohol and drinks with caffeine like coffee, because they'll make you pass more water from your body.Try to avoid going out during the hottest time of the day.  If you have to go out, try to stay in the shade.When you go outside, wear light-colored, loose clothing, and wear a hat or carry a parasol to protect your head.On very hot days, it's also best to avoid working or exercising too much outside.","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.Have you ever experienced heat exhaustion?

They did a study to test the health benefits of this type of walking in 2007.Participants were put into three groups. One group followed the Japanese walking routine, while the second group was told to walk at a moderate pace four times a week, with a goal of at least 8,000 steps a day.

It found that people who went to bed and woke up at different times each day had a 26% higher risk of serious heart problems like heart attacks, strokes and heart failure.This was true even when they got the recommended seven to nine hours of sleep.Even after considering other health factors like age, exercise, smoking, alcohol use and diet, the link between irregular sleep and heart problems stayed strong.Researchers used a score called the Sleep Regularity Index (SRI) to measure sleep consistency. The SRI ranges from 0 (very irregular sleep) to 100 (very regular sleep).Participants were put into three groups: regular sleepers, with an SRI above 87.3; moderately irregular sleepers, with an SRI between 71.6 and 87.3; and irregular sleepers, with an SRI below 71.6.People with higher SRI scores had a much lower risk of heart disease. Even a moderate score of 77.1 was linked to a 15% drop in heart risk.Changing your sleeping and waking times can confuse your body's internal clock. And this may affect how your body handles things like blood sugar, stress, and even how your heart works.This is why keeping a consistent sleep schedule matters.

For older adults, it matters again as they start to rely more on others for support.And where you live matters too. In countries where trust levels are high, especially trust in strangers and society — like Finland and Denmark — the connection between trust and happiness was found to be even stronger.Still, trusting others more is easier said than done.As Catrin Finkenauer, co-author of the study, said: ""Trust can't be forced — it has to be earned."" She added that families, schools and governments all help create environments where trust — and well-being — can grow.","Exercise 3QuestionsAnswer the following questions about the article.1.What types of trust did the study look at?2.Why is trust especially important for older adults?3.Was the relationship between trust and happiness stronger or weaker in countries where trust levels are high?","Exercise 4DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on the study's findings?2.Do you find it surprising that people who trust others feel happier?3.Do you have a lot of trust in strangers and society in general?4.How much trust do you have in your country's institutions?5.Do you imagine trust levels are high in your country?"

Inspired by this, they decided to look at changes at a molecular level.The research team studied a group of 108 people aged between 25 and 75. These participants gave biological samples every few months over a number of years.From these samples, the researchers looked at changes in many different kinds of molecules in the human body. Altogether, they tracked changes in over 135,000 different molecules.They found that 81% of these molecules showed big changes in their numbers — either increasing or decreasing — during two particular time periods, averaging around the ages of 44 and 60.For people in their 40s, changes were seen in the number of molecules linked to heart disease, muscle and skin, and the body's ability to break down alcohol and caffeine.For those in their 60s, changes were again seen in molecules linked to heart disease, muscle and skin, as well as molecules linked to kidney function, the immune system and the body's ability to break down carbohydrates.The researchers said their findings show that people should pay attention to their health in their 40s and 60s. That could mean exercising more to keep your muscles in good shape and to protect your heart, or reducing how much caffeine and alcohol you drink.Michael Snyder, an author on the study, said, ""I'm a big believer that we should try to adjust our lifestyles while we're still healthy.""","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on Stanford University's findings? 2.Do you find it surprising that the aging process speeds up dramatically in our mid-40s and early 60s? 3.In your opinion, what are the best ways to slow down the aging process?4.Have you made any healthy changes to your lifestyle in recent years? 5.What do you think would be the ideal human lifespan?","Exercise 4Further Discussion Have a discussion based on the following questions.1.Would you say you feel younger or older than your actual age?2.Do you know anyone who doesn't seem to age at all?3.If it were possible, would you want to live forever?4.Who are the healthiest elderly people you know?5.If you could give your younger self one piece of health advice, what would it be?"

Half of them also used a smartwatch, which tracked their heart rate and how active they were. The watch also sent messages, gave feedback and let participants contact their coach.The study found that people with smartwatches were 10 times more likely to start exercising regularly.

Even a year later, they were three times more likely to still be exercising.But the researchers say just wearing a smartwatch isn't enough — what matters is how you use it.Other research has found that smartwatches work best when you follow a clear plan and build healthy habits.Experts say you should start with small, realistic goals, such as walking for 20 minutes each day. Use reminders on your watch or phone to help you stay consistent. Check your progress often, and notice how you improve — this can help you stay motivated.It also helps to share your goals with a friend or coach.

The WHO also says there are 1.3 billion tobacco users worldwide, with 80% of them living in low- or middle-income countries.And recent data has confirmed tobacco as one of the leading causes of death on the planet. Whether through smoking, chewing or even secondhand smoke, researchers estimate that more than 7 million deaths in 2023 could be attributed to tobacco. This is according to a report presented to the recent World Conference on Tobacco Control in Dublin, Ireland. Researchers based their findings on data from the Global Burden of Disease study published by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington.The researchers estimated rates of disease linked with tobacco exposure for men and women in 204 countries from 1990 to 2023.According to the report, tobacco exposure is actually the leading risk factor for deaths among men. In 2023, an estimated 5.6 million deaths among men could be attributed to tobacco. Meanwhile, data from the United Nations shows that a total of about 33 million men died globally that year.Among women, 1.8 million deaths could be attributed to tobacco, making it their seventh major risk factor for death.Globally, deaths associated with tobacco exposure rose around 24% between 1990 and 2023.However, in some countries, the number of these deaths has been dropping. In fact, the UK has seen tobacco deaths fall 45% since 1990 — the largest proportional decrease among countries with over 50,000 tobacco deaths.On the other hand, Egypt saw the biggest proportional increase, with deaths attributable to tobacco rising 124% since 1990.The Guardian reports Brooks Morgan from the IHME as saying, ""While some countries are seeing encouraging declines in tobacco-related deaths, others are heading in the opposite direction.""""These trends highlight the urgent need for accelerated implementation and stronger enforcement of strategies proven to reduce tobacco use,"" he added.","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on the findings of this report? 2.Do you find it surprising that tobacco is the leading death risk factor for men? 3.Do you know more male or female smokers? 4.What steps has your government taken to discourage people from smoking?5.Do you think there is enough education about the health impacts of smoking in your country?","Exercise 4Further Discussion Have a discussion based on the following questions.1.How have smoking habits changed in your country over the last few decades?2.Would you support a total ban on tobacco products in your country? 3.What advice would you give to someone who's trying to quit smoking?4.Is smoking in public allowed in your town or city? 5.Giving up smoking is the easiest thing in the world.

But while you'll find that a lot of this ""focus"" music is very calm, new research suggests that ""groovier"" songs might actually be a better choice.Researchers in the US looked at how four different types of sound affected how 280 participants completed a task.The study compared two types of ""focus"" music, as well as pop music and, to represent a more natural working environment, ""calm office noise.""The two types of focus music were called ""work flow"" and ""deep focus.""""Work flow"" came from a music therapy app, and had a moderate tempo. ""Deep focus"" came from a playlist of the same name on Spotify, and was slower and calmer.A ""Hot 100"" playlist from October 2021 was used for pop music, and the office noise was made using an online sound generator.Study participants were put into four groups, one for each playlist. They were asked questions about their mood, and then asked to do a ""flanker task"" while listening to one of the playlists.A flanker task usually asks participants to say which way an arrow is pointing when it's surrounded by other symbols added to confuse them. This is used to test attention levels.When the task was finished, participants were asked about their mood again.The choice of music didn't affect accuracy in the flanker tasks, but it did affect speed. In particular, participants who listened to the ""work flow"" playlist finished the task 7% faster, and they also experienced more improved moods than the other groups.According to the study authors, this suggests the best music to help get work done is music that puts you in a good mood and makes you feel energized.In the study, ""work flow"" was both widely liked and had a good ""groove.""

In March of 2020, the figure was 56%.The survey also showed that younger employees, new employees, hybrid workers and office workers were especially likely to say that expectations for their roles aren't clear.Clarity of expectations is one of the key elements Gallup uses to measure employee engagement. According to Gallup, the percentage of US employees who feel engaged at work fell to a 10-year low of 31% in 2024.Other elements used to measure employee engagement also saw a significant drop.When asked if they felt that someone at work cared for them as a person, only 38% of US employees felt strongly that this was true. This was a drop from 47% in March 2020.And when asked if there was someone at work who was encouraging their development, only 30% strongly agreed. This was down from 36% in March 2020.Gallup suggests several reasons for the fall in employee engagement.Since the coronavirus pandemic, many businesses have undergone rapid changes in their organization, and many more employees are working hybrid or fully remotely. And many management systems have failed to adapt to these changes.To improve employee engagement, Gallup suggests companies train managers to improve their communication skills so they can build better relationships with their staff. Companies should also carefully choose managers who show an ability to inspire and encourage workers.To make sure that employees understand what is expected of them, Gallup suggests managers have conversations with their staff about what is expected in a changing work situation.

But because the world's economies are closely linked by trade, the negative impacts of weather in one country are likely to have negative impacts in other countries too.The scientists wanted to see how adding global weather conditions would affect forecasts of climate change's impact on the world's economy.They found that the economic forecast was much worse. In the worst scenario, in which the world warms by 4.4 degrees Celsius by the year 2100, global wealth would be reduced by 40% — not 11% as previously forecast.The scientists say that to avoid too much damage to the world's economy, a target of 1.7 degrees of warming — similar to the Paris Agreement target — would be better to aim for than 2.7 degrees.","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on the findings of this study?2.Do you find it concerning that climate change could reduce global wealth by 40% by the end of the century?3.Do you think world leaders will start taking climate change more seriously in the coming years?4.Has your country made any changes recently to any of its climate policies?5.How much do you know about your government's emissions targets?","Exercise 4Further Discussion Have a discussion based on the following questions.1.How proactive would you say your country is in fighting climate change?2.Are the effects of climate change already being felt in any parts of your country?3.Have you taken any steps to reduce your carbon footprint? 4.What concerns you most about climate change? 5.We need to stop funding our own extinction. — Unknown.

Lego says it will achieve that goal by early 2026.It's the Danish company's sixth factory and its second in Asia. It will use high-tech equipment to produce colorful Lego bricks for the growing markets in Asia.Lego's CEO Niels Christiansen told The Associated Press that the company wanted to make sure that it looks after the planet for future generations.The factory is an important part of Lego's aim to stop adding greenhouse gases to the environment by 2050.It has a shorter-term target of reducing emissions by 37% by 2032.The company makes its bricks out of oil-based plastic — colored plastic grains are melted at high temperatures and then fed into metal molds.Lego says it has invested more than $1.2 billion in a search for more sustainable alternatives. But those efforts have not always been successful.Vietnam also aims to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, so it needs more of its factories to use clean energy. The country hopes the plant's 12,400 solar panels and energy storage system will help encourage other factories to begin looking at ways to make manufacturing more sustainable.The highly automated factory uses robots for making the bricks and then packaging them, but it will eventually employ thousands of workers to operate these machines.Some of them have already begun work after being trained in Lego's factory in eastern China.The factory will benefit from a new 2024 rule that allows big foreign companies to buy clean energy directly from solar and wind power producers and to meet their clean energy requirements.And it will be linked to an adjacent energy center where electricity can be stored in large batteries.","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on Lego opening a clean energy factory in Vietnam?2.Do you think Lego is likely to reach its zero-emissions goal by 2050?3.Would you be more likely to support a brand that follows eco-friendly practices?4.Are there any companies in your country known for their environmental efforts?5.Do you think it'd be fun working for Lego?","Exercise 4Further Discussion Have a discussion based on the following questions.1.Did you play with Lego as a kid?2.Do you know any adult Lego fans? 3.What were some of your favorite toys growing up?

According to the World Economic Forum (WEF), this is not only good news for workers, but for business too.The WEF points out that most business leaders understand what a difference worker well-being can make to a company's performance. It can mean better customer service and financial results, as well as helping them recruit and retain top talent.Business consultants McKinsey & Company say improving worker health and well-being could even generate $3.7 trillion to $11.7 trillion for the global economy.Better health among workers is associated with higher labor force participation. And every 1% to 3% increase in global labor force participation is worth $1.4 billion to $4.2 billion to the world economy, according to McKinsey.On the other hand, McKinsey also says employees who are facing mental health or other well-being challenges are four times more likely to want to leave their job.In the Asia Pacific (APAC) region, nearly 40% of organizations identified worker well-being as their top priority for the next five years in research company Aon's 2022-2023 Global Wellbeing Survey.The same research found that investment in well-being has risen in APAC by 27% since 2020, which is a faster increase than in any other region. Half of the businesses that took part in the survey said they ""allocated 4% of their overall company and benefits funding to well-being.""Polling company Gallup has identified five key elements of well-being, including physical health, social life, career, finances and community. And Gallup says employers can make the biggest improvement to their workers' well-being by focusing on people's careers and finances.Gallup says business leaders should create a culture of development, helping their teams build their skills.

It's often chosen to create a nice atmosphere for customers, but it doesn't always do the same for employees.And new research shows that when music at work doesn't match what workers need, it can affect their energy, mood and ability to focus.For the study, led by researchers from the US and Hong Kong, 166 people listened to different songs while doing a task.Before the study started, participants rated how important four parts of music were for helping them work well: volume, speed, complexity and emotional intensity.Emotional intensity means how strong the feelings in the music are — so someone doing creative work might prefer soft, calm music, and someone doing repetitive tasks might want happy, upbeat music.The participants then listened to one of two playlists while doing a creative task. One playlist had upbeat, happy pop music with medium complexity. The other playlist was slower, quieter, and had a sadder mood.After the task, the participants rated how well the music matched what they said they needed.The results showed that when the music didn't match what people needed, they felt more tired, less happy and worked less effectively. Workers who had trouble ignoring background noise were the most affected.The researchers suggest that employers consider the needs of employees, not just customers, when choosing music, and introducing quiet areas or noise-reducing earbuds may help. If the job allows it, letting workers choose their own music could also be a good solution.A 2016 study by TotalJobs supports this idea. It found that 79% of people believe music helps them at work, and 84% of those who were not allowed to listen to music said they would benefit from doing so.","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on the findings of this study? 2.Do you usually listen to your own music at work?3.What kinds of music do you find distracting when you're trying to focus?4.Have you ever felt annoyed by background music in a store or workplace?5.Do you like the same kinds of music as your coworkers?","Exercise 4Further Discussion Have a discussion based on the following questions.1.How much time do you spend listening to music each day?2.Has your taste in music changed at all over the years?3.Are there any musicians you've only recently discovered?4.Do you ever make playlists for different moods or activities?5.Are there any music genres that you particularly dislike?"

Even employees who were happy at their job were more likely to consider quitting if a close friend from their starting group began job-hunting.The effect was strongest when the friendships were close, and those who spoke regularly and had strong bonds were more likely to follow each other's decisions.But this trend can be reduced by something simple — letting employees work in the city they prefer. When companies placed new workers in their chosen location, they were much less likely to be influenced by friends who were thinking about leaving.The study shows that work friends are more than just friendly faces — they can influence how you feel about your job and what decisions you make next!","Exercise 3QuestionsAnswer the following questions about the article.1.How many new employees did the study follow?2.How many new employees had left the company by the end of the study?3.What simple thing can companies do to reduce the influence of friends quitting?","Exercise 4DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on the findings of this study?2.Does it surprise you that work friends could have such a big influence on a person's career choices?3.Who are your closest friends at work?4.Do you think you'd consider leaving your job if a close work friend quit?5.If you had a choice between working with close friends or working in your preferred city, which would you choose?"

You want to make a good impression, show off your skills, and be honest.But sometimes, being too honest might hurt your chances. For example, you might have a big gap in your resume. Maybe you were traveling, studying, or dealing with personal matters. That's okay — but some employers may see a gap in your resume as a red flag.Career expert Guy Thornton says it's okay to shape your answers in a way that helps you get the job. That doesn't mean lying, but it does mean being smart about how you tell your story.Speaking to the UK's Mail Online, Thornton suggests turning any time off into something positive. So talk about how you used that time to improve yourself — maybe you did freelance work, took an online course, or learned new skills, for example.He also shared advice for the classic interview question, ""What are your weaknesses?""""The employer isn't looking for a list of your flaws,"" Thornton said.Instead, he suggests the ""10:90"" rule: spend 10% of your answer talking about the weakness, and 90% talking about how you're working to improve it.For example, if you struggle with deadlines, you can explain that you're learning to manage your time better and not take on too much at once.Also, be careful when talking about your career goals, Thornton says. If you're only applying for a job to earn money while planning something else, it's best not to say that in the interview. Employers want to hire people who seem excited to work with them!So, when answering this question, focus on what you can learn from the job or how it fits your current goals.In the end, it's not about being perfect — it's about showing that you're a good fit for the job. So choose your words carefully and share your story in the best way possible!","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on Guy Thornton's advice? 2.Do you tend to be fully honest in job interviews? 3.What was the last job interview you had?

Turing was a British scientist who broke German codes during World War II, and is credited with creating the foundations for modern computing.Despite his work being so important, Turing faced jail for having a relationship with another man, which was against the law in the UK at the time. And so, in 1954, it's believed Turing ate an apple that he had put poison into, and died.The story goes that Apple chose a bitten apple for its logo as a tribute to him.But this is most likely a myth.When journalist Holden Frith researched the origins of the logo back in 2005, he was told by an Apple employee that the story linking the Apple logo to Alan Turing was true.But when Frith asked a different Apple employee a few years later, they said it was probably a myth.Others have suggested that Apple's bitten fruit logo represents knowledge, like the bites Adam and Eve took from the fruit of the tree of knowledge in the Bible.But this probably isn't true, either.The real story behind the Apple logo is actually a lot simpler than all that, according to its designer, Rob Janoff.In an interview with CreativeBits in 2020, Janoff explained that he chose to put a bite in the apple so people could tell how big it was, and wouldn't mistake it for a cherry.He said he hadn't even known that a ""byte"" is a computer term — he learned that after he designed it!","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on the story behind Apple's logo?2.What would you say are some of the most recognizable logos in your country?3.Do you know the origin stories of any other famous logos? 4.What are some of the best logos you've seen?5.Could you see yourself working for Apple?","Exercise 4Further Discussion Have a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your country's biggest tech companies? 2.Do any of your friends or family work in the tech industry?3.How do you imagine the tech industry will change over the next few decades?4.What tech companies would you invest in if you had money to spare?5.Design is not just what it looks like and feels like.

Instead, hybrid work is becoming the norm.At least, that's the situation in Australia, where data from the Australian HR Institute says there has been no increase in companies ordering their employees to return to the office this year.The Institute found that 44% of workplaces require staff to be in the office between three and five days a week.

However, they may not actually need to be forced back — many are happy to spend some time at their workplace.One manager, David Portway of NDE Solutions, said he finds that staff want to be in the office for meetings and to chat with colleagues.He believes that flexibility is important, which may mean allowing people to choose which days they work from home, or letting them come to the office after taking their children to school.","Exercise 3QuestionsAnswer the following questions about the article.1.What percentage of workplaces required staff to be in the office between three and five days a week?2.What was the most common working arrangement in Australia?3.How many companies in Australia were surveyed?","Exercise 4DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on the Australian HR Institute's findings?2.How did the pandemic change the way you work?3.Is hybrid work now common in your country?4.How do you expect working arrangements to change in your country over the next few years?5.What would be the perfect working arrangement for you?"

But the country has a shrinking population and aging workforce.And while California's economy is growing, toward the end of April, the IMF cut its economic growth forecast for Japan, as it predicted that trade tensions and ""high policy uncertainty"" would have an impact on Asian markets.However, Newsom has also expressed concern over the effect of President Donald Trump's global tariffs on his state's economy, and has even filed a lawsuit challenging the president's use of emergency powers to bring tariffs into effect without going through congress.","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on California overtaking Japan as the world's fourth-largest economy?2.Have you visited California?

It was found in a random inspection in mid-May.Theeraj said Thai authorities are looking to press charges, including falsely declaring imported goods and illegally importing electronic waste. Authorities are planning to return the waste to the US.Theeraj said it was important to take action. ""There are environmental impacts that are dangerous to the people, especially communities around factories that might import these things for processing, then recycling,"" he said.Thailand passed a ban on the import of a range of electronic waste products in 2020. The Cabinet in February approved an expanded list of the banned waste.Electronic waste creates huge health hazards. Many components contain lead and mercury, cadmium and other toxins.Recyclers are after gold, silver, palladium and copper, mainly from printed circuit boards.

He blamed Japanese checks that imported vehicles must pass before they can be used on the country's roads.It's true that US cars aren't very common in Japan, but many people in the country say it's not because of these checks. They say American vehicles are too large for the busy streets and small parking spaces in Japanese cities, and that US cars are less reliable and less efficient.Data from the Japan Automobile Importers Association (JAIA) in 2024 shows that sales of imported foreign cars fell by 8.5% in Japan last year, with about 227,000 sold. About 4.4 million cars were sold in total, with almost one-third of them Toyotas.Among imported cars, German vehicles were the most popular with Japanese buyers. For the 10th year in a row, Mercedes-Benz was the most popular imported brand, with more than 53,000 sold.The next four most popular brands were all also from Germany: BMW, Volkswagen, Audi and Mini.The only US brand in the top 10 was Jeep, which is made by Chrysler. Around 9,500 of these vehicles were sold in Japan last year. All of the other brands in the top 10 were European, including Sweden's Volvo, Germany's Porsche, the UK's Land Rover and France's Peugeot.Experts say that while Trump wants US carmakers to sell to Japan, the companies themselves are not as interested in the Japanese market.However, the US and Japan have been holding trade talks since Trump announced new tariffs at the start of April.Those tariffs have worried Japanese carmakers, including Toyota and Nissan.

You could eat the best food, travel the world and wear the most fashionable clothes — right?Of course a lot of rich people do those things, but if you look at some of the world's top CEOs, you'll see they wear the same simple clothes almost every day.Think of Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg, who has often been known to wear a simple gray t-shirt and pants. Steve Jobs, the co-founder of Apple, used to wear a black top with blue jeans and New Balance shoes.The reason? Zuckerberg once said that he wears the same outfits because he doesn't want to waste energy on life's small decisions.Former US President Barack Obama said something similar. ""I don't want to make decisions about what I'm eating or wearing,"" he told Vanity Fair in 2012. ""Because I have too many other decisions to make.""It could be that they want to avoid something known as ""decision fatigue."" This is the idea that every decision we make uses some energy, so we may get tired if we have to make a lot of them in one day. That could cause us to make decisions that aren't so good.But there could be a different reason. Writing for Forbes in 2017, Nick Hobson said these CEOs wear the same thing because they like to be in control. The rest of the time, their work includes a lot of uncertainty.So should we all start wearing the same thing every day? No, says writer Blake Snow. He believes that if you're not a millionaire CEO, a carefully chosen outfit is important because it can help you to make a good impression.","Exercise 3QuestionsAnswer the following questions about the article.1.Why did Mark Zuckerberg say he wears the same clothes every day?2.What is decision fatigue?3.Why does Nick Hobson think CEOs like wearing the same clothes?","Exercise 4DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on the idea of wearing the same outfit every day?2.Do you spend much time deciding what to wear each day?3.Do you know anyone who wears a similar outfit every day?4.Who are some of the most stylish dressers you know?5.Do you think your clothing style would change if you became a billionaire?"

It put workers into four groups: people who always worked remotely, people who had hybrid working arrangements, those who worked in an office but were able to work remotely if they wanted to, and those who worked in an office and could not work remotely.The survey found that remote workers were most likely to feel engaged in their work — meaning they were likely to be interested in and focused on what they were doing. Thirty-one percent of remote workers said they felt engaged.Among employees who always worked from an office, and were not able to work remotely, only 19% said they felt engaged.However, many fully remote workers reported feeling negative emotions in their lives.Forty-five percent of fully remote workers — and 46% of hybrid workers — said they felt stress. At least one-quarter of remote workers also reported feeling anger, loneliness and sadness.Remote workers were more likely to feel these things compared to people working from an office.Ryan Pendell from Gallup believes there are several reasons for this.The first, he said, is that people miss seeing their colleagues and doing things like having lunch together.Pendell added that it can also be stressful when you have to manage your time on your own, and people may also find it stressful to always be communicating with colleagues online.He said that companies should be thinking about the needs of all their employees, whether they're in the office or working from home.","Exercise 3QuestionsAnswer the following questions about the article.1.What percentage of office workers said they felt engaged in their work?2.Were remote or office workers more likely to feel stressed?3.What does Ryan Pendell think companies should do?","Exercise 4DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on Gallup's findings?2.Do you find it surprising that remote workers are more likely to feel stressed?3.Why do you think only 19% of office workers feel engaged?4.Do you tend to feel more interested in and focused on your job when working from home or from the office?5.What do you think companies could do to better support remote workers?"

But have you ever come out of a meeting feeling negative and less engaged in your work?This feeling has been described by Harvard Business Review as a ""meeting hangover.""  And experts say that too many bad meetings can really affect productivity.According to a survey done by researchers at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, more than 90% of people experience a meeting hangover at least some of the time.It means they need time to recover after a meeting, and during this time they're not getting any work done.And many people also said that when they feel badly after a meeting, they vent their frustrations to colleagues, which means negative feelings are shared around the office.Common meeting frustrations that people named included listening to discussions about things that don't feel relevant, and not having enough opportunities for people to discuss their ideas.So how can companies make sure their meetings don't have a negative impact on productivity?First, says Matt Abrahams from Stanford, make sure you really need a meeting.If you're sure the meeting is necessary, the North Carolina researchers say you should then think about who really needs to be there.Then, think about how long the meeting needs to be — no one likes to have their time wasted. ""It's OK to have a 22-minute meeting if that's all the time you need,"" Abrahams says.And before a meeting ends, everyone should be clear on what they need to do next.However, there will still be some bad meetings. If you come out of one feeling negative, experts suggest taking a walk or spending some time doing some breathing exercises to get you ready for the rest of the day.","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.Have you ever experienced a ""meeting hangover""? 2.Do you have a lot of meetings during an average work week?3.Have you had any meetings recently that felt like a waste of time? 4.Do you often get a chance to share your thoughts or ideas during meetings? 5.Who do you usually go to when you need to vent about work?","Exercise 4Further Discussion Have a discussion based on the following questions.1.Do you prefer in-person meetings or video calls? 2.Is there anything you'd like to change about your working arrangements? 3.What do you usually do when you start feeling tired or unmotivated at work?4.Do you have any tips for staying productive at work? 5.How long have you been in your current position?"

In other countries, you don't have to tip but it's nice to do if the service has been very good.And then there are some countries where tipping just isn't a part of the culture.This includes Japan, where a tip may even be refused, much to the surprise of the tourist offering it. However, a Japanese business has sparked debate by putting tip boxes in its restaurants.A photo taken in a Gyukatsu Motomura — a shop known for its beef cutlets that has 24 restaurants in Japan — has been shared online showing a plastic tip box by its cash register. The box says, ""Tip Box.  Thank you!!"" in English, and looks to be full of 1,000 yen and $5 bills.SoraNews24  writes that Gyukatsu Motomura actually put tip boxes in all of its restaurants in February 2024, except for those where the managers of the buildings the restaurants were in wouldn't allow them.  It says it did this because foreign visitors kept trying to give tips to staff.This was a problem because income tax would need to be paid on those tips. Japanese businesses usually file taxes for their workers, and Gyukatsu Motomura decided using a tip box would make it easier to manage those taxes.Some people online have said that the tip boxes are a good way for businesses to make more money from the increased tourism Japan has seen recently.

The airport is in the city of Kitaakita in Akita prefecture, home prefecture of the Akita dog.The Akita dog has a history going back to the early 17th century, when it was used to hunt deer, boars and bears. They are medium-sized dogs, with big heads, pointy ears, deep eyes and curly tails.But the number of Akita dogs in Japan has been decreasing. In 2023, there were just over 1,800 Akita dogs in Japan, and they are not seen as often as they once were.Probably the most famous Akita dog was Hachiko. Born in 1923, Hachiko would walk with his owner to Tokyo's Shibuya Station every day, and then return to the station in the evening to wait for his owner's return.Hachiko's owner died suddenly, but Hachiko kept going to the station every day to wait for him. A statue of Hachiko is now a popular place to meet outside Shibuya Station, and Hachi: A Dog's Tale, a movie starring Richard Gere based on Hachiko's story, was a big hit in 2009.Akita dogs have been greeting passengers at Odate-Noshiro Airport on the eighth day of every month since 2016. The eighth day was chosen to honor Hachiko, because hachi means ""eight"" in Japanese.A male Akita dog called Rensui, and his sister Ruka, were made airport directors to further promote both the airport and Akita dogs.At a special event at the airport on May 18, Kensuke Ishida, the mayor of the nearby city of Odate, said he expected the two dogs to bring smiles to the faces of many people.","Exercise 3QuestionsAnswer the following questions about the article.1.How many Akita dogs did Japan have in 2023?2.When was Hachiko born?3.What are the names of the Akita dogs that have been made directors at Odate-Noshiro Airport?","Exercise 4DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on the two Akita dogs being made directors at Odate-Noshiro Airport?2.Would you enjoy being greeted by dogs at an airport?3.Do you often see Akita dogs where you live?

But what if you really don't want to leave your job — or you just can't?The first thing to do, says management expert Liane Davey, is to check that your workplace — or your boss — really is toxic.Tell other people at work about the way you feel and ask if they feel the same way.If they do, then it may be useful to accept that you can't change things all on your own, says Traci Pedersen from the Healthline website.Jennifer Herrity from jobs website Indeed suggests you surround yourself with positive people. Spend more time with these people, she says, because they should help to improve your workplace experience.However, Kevin Murphy from the University of Limerick in Ireland says you should try not to take part in negative gossip because this can make you feel worse about work.Pedersen adds that it's also important to remember your values. If someone at work is cruel to you, don't be cruel too.And management expert Davey says that you shouldn't let a toxic boss make you feel bad about yourself — try to stay positive and remember your strengths.Of course, when you have to go into a toxic workplace every day, it can become very difficult.So, some experts suggest you speak to HR if you feel that doing so won't make things worse.You could also ask your company if you could do more work from home. That way, you may have more control of your situation.If that's not possible, Herrity says you should make sure you have things to look forward to at home. Leave your work problems at work and enjoy the time that's your own.","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.Do you know anyone who works in a toxic environment?2.Have you ever had to work closely with a difficult colleague?3.Who are the most positive people you work with?4.What would you say your strengths are at work?5.Do you ever have trouble leaving your problems at work?","Exercise 4Further Discussion Have a discussion based on the following questions.1.What do you most enjoy about your job?2.What do your colleagues complain about most often at work?3.Which of your friends or family do you think has the best work environment?4.How would you create a positive work environment if you were a manager?5.People don't leave bad jobs, they leave bad bosses. — Unknown.

However, some have questioned not only how sustainable their products are, but what they mean for market competition.The Japanese government is considering ending an exemption that allows products from these low-cost e-commerce businesses into the country tax-free.Japan has a tax exemption on parcels worth less than 10,000 yen, which is around $70. With jeans, a shirt and shoes — a whole outfit — costing less than 10,000 yen on Shein, and similar prices on Temu, this means a lot of products arrive into the country tax-free.Government tax experts recently met to discuss the problems caused by this tax-free channel into the Japanese market. The experts discussed concerns around fair competition, and also how this could be a way for counterfeit goods to enter the country, said The Japan Times. Another group set up by the Ministry of Finance is examining similar issues.If the government does end the exemption, those parcels from Shein and Temu could become subject to Japan's sales tax, which is 10% for most items.Japan is not alone in reviewing how low-cost goods are getting into their country. The US has ended its tax exemption on parcels worth less than $800. Parcels from China up to the value of $800 are now subject to a 120% tax rate or a flat fee of $100, which may yet rise.In response, Temu said it will no longer sell products directly to US consumers. Instead, it will ship its products to local sellers who will then fulfill orders.In Europe, customs authorities said that in 2024, they handled around 4.6 billion low-value packages that were bought online, with 91% of them coming from China. The European Union (EU) is now discussing adding a handling fee of about $2.30 to small packages sent directly to consumers.The EU also says it wants to end the duty-free status of goods arriving into the bloc with a value of less than about $170, but not until 2028.","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on Japan ending its tax exemption for low-cost goods?2.Do you ever buy from Shein or Temu? 3.Do you think the tax will impact the popularity of Shein and Temu products?4.Do you prefer online shopping or going to stores in person?5.What are some of your favorite brands or stores?","Exercise 4Further Discussion Have a discussion based on the following questions.1.Do you often make impulse purchases?2.Have you ever bought something and regretted it immediately?3.Is there anything you've had your eye on for a while that you'd like to buy?4.Do you usually read reviews before buying things?5.Who are the biggest shopaholics you know?"

The S&P 500 rose more than 23% last year and profits for companies in the index rose more than 9%.According to the survey, the median pay package for CEOs rose to $17.1 million, up 9.7%. Meanwhile, the median employee at companies in the survey earned $85,419, reflecting a 1.7% increase year over year.CEOs had to deal with inflation and relatively high interest rates last year, as well as declining consumer confidence. However, consumers kept spending; inflation did subside; the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates; and the job market stayed strong.At half the companies in The Associated Press' pay survey, it would take the worker at the middle of the company's pay scale 192 years to make what the CEO did in one.

Nintendo is counting on the Switch 2 to boost dropping sales.In Japan, the new consoles were sold through a competitive lottery system that Nintendo said got about 2.2 million applications. Outside the official draw, some retailers offered their own lotteries to preorder the devices.The new console comes with a larger and higher resolution screen than its predecessor, with improved processing power, offering smoother and more vivid graphics.Central to its updated system is a new ""C"" button on its controller, which will launch a ""GameChat"" feature that requires a subscription to Nintendo's Switch online service. It allows players to ""communicate with friends and family while playing a game,"" and lets them share their game screen with others. A built-in microphone will also allow chatting with other gamers.Nintendo has said it expects to sell 15 million Switch 2 consoles for the fiscal year through March 2026.The company has promised to roll out attractive software for the Switch 2 later this year, including The Legend of Zelda games, a Pokemon title and a Kirby game, as well as offerings from outside software companies.Nintendo is capitalizing on the launch with the opening of a store in San Francisco and the Super Nintendo World amusement facility in Orlando, Florida, both set for this month.The Switch 2's launch arrives at an uncertain time for much of the gaming industry due to new tariffs implemented by US President Donald Trump.In the US, the Switch 2's launch price is $449.99 — significantly higher than the original Switch's price of $299.US preorders for the Switch 2 were delayed for several weeks so the company could assess the potential impact of tariffs.","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on the launch of Nintendo Switch 2?2.Do you think $449.99 is a reasonable price for a gaming console?3.Do you expect Nintendo to sell over 15 million Switch 2 consoles by March 2026?4.Have you owned any Nintendo consoles?

Companies offered job security, and in return, workers stayed loyal until they retired.But this tradition began to change in the 1990s, when the Japanese economy weakened and more people started to change jobs. And after the global financial crisis of the late 2000s, many firms stopped offering lifetime employment altogether.But now, some young people are looking for stability again.A recent survey by NCB Research & Consulting found that 37% of new employees in Japan say they want to stay at their current company until retirement — an increase of nearly nine percentage points compared to last year.The survey was given to 878 new workers in the southern Kyushu and western Chugoku regions of Japan. It looked at the goals and feelings of new employees as they started their careers.When asked about how their job search went, most respondents were happy. About 62% got jobs at the companies they wanted, the highest result since the survey first started. Another 34% said things mostly went the way they hoped.This high level of satisfaction may be one reason why more people feel ready to commit to long-term work.Still, not everyone wants to stay at the same job forever.About 12% of workers say they plan to change jobs someday. Another 23% say they might switch if they decide their company isn't a good fit for them. And 8% want to start their own business or become independent someday.The idea of staying in the same job for life may not be as strong as before.

For many, they offer more than just a place to spend time — they help people avoid awkward talks about being out of work.One woman, who calls herself Zonghua, told Spanish newspaper El País that she uses these fake offices because they're cheaper than spending every day in a cafe, and more comfortable than a library.Zonghua left her job in finance in 2024 because she was tired and wanted a quieter life.

And five years later, it looks like those charges may have had an impact.According to a new survey, 48% of shoppers never buy a plastic bag when they're at a store, and 36% of people rarely buy one.Instead, almost three-quarters of people take reusable bags to the store. And 45% also try to buy products in refillable containers, meaning they can take the containers back to the store and use them again.This aligns with data from Japan's Ministry of the Environment, which found that the number of plastic bags used decreased by about 50% between July 2020 and March 2022.The new survey was done by a sales company called Mitoriz, which also asked people about the ways they recycle.Most said they sort their waste and follow recycling rules, though almost 10% said they don't understand those rules.The survey also found that older people are more likely to take their own bags to stores and sort their recycling in the right way.However, plastic waste is still a big problem.

But that could be changing.According to information from the Japanese government, in October 2024 there were more than 32,000 Japanese nationals living in Singapore.And at the start of that year, it was ranked the ""most liveable city"" for East Asian nationals working abroad by software company ECA International.The company said Singapore is popular because it's clean, safe and has excellent facilities. And although it's an expensive place to live, rates of pay tend to be good for skilled workers, and the fact that the locals speak English means it attracts people from around the world.However, that figure of 32,000 Japanese nationals was down from a total above 37,000 in 2016. And there has been a general trend of Japanese expats moving home over the last five years.The number of Japanese nationals living abroad permanently or on a long-term basis hit a record high of more than 1.4 million in 2019.  But that number has fallen since the start of the coronavirus pandemic.And while Singapore remains a popular destination, the country has made things more difficult for foreign workers in recent years.A July 2024 report from Bloomberg noted that entry-level and middle-of-the-market jobs were ""increasingly being reserved for the resident population.""And in September last year, Singapore introduced a new points-based system and minimum salary threshold for foreign workers. These changes came after locals complained that their job prospects had suffered as a result of the waves of foreign workers arriving in the country. And many locals felt that the changes were ""long overdue,"" said Bloomberg's Karishma Vaswani.If these changes do mean that more Japanese workers return to their homeland, it could be good news for the country's own industries, which are struggling with a labor shortage.And those workers do have a desirable country to come back to.

Try This Expert TipWhen you go to a job interview, your goal is usually to tell the company how great you are!You might want them to know you're smart, work hard, work well on your own but you also love working in a team — and that you're just fantastic!But then they hit you with the question: ""What are your weaknesses?"" Or: ""What areas do you think you could improve?"" What's a good answer?You might not want to say you're bad at working early in the morning or that you're quick to get angry.A common answer people use is that they work too hard — but that doesn't really sound like a weakness.Speaking to The Mirror, an ""interview expert"" said that the company interviewing you doesn't need to know about your personality flaws.Instead, you should choose something specific and related to the job you're interviewing for, the unnamed expert said.For example, if you're interviewing for a job at a hotel, you could say you don't have much experience working with a certain booking system. But add that you're happy to learn.This is a weakness that's really easy to fix, and something you'd get better at quite quickly with a little bit of help.Of course, you can't make the weakness too big or the company won't want to give you a job! So, for example, if you're interviewing for a job working as a computer programmer, don't tell the interviewer you're no good at coding.You could instead choose something more specific, like a certain coding language you'd like to get better at.If you speak well in the interview, small weaknesses like these shouldn't be a problem. And you can also remind the interviewer that you really like to work on weaknesses and learn new things.","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on this interview advice? 2.Have you ever been asked about your weaknesses in an interview?

But while the US company's shareholders approved the purchase four months later, it was opposed by the United Steelworkers union (USW), which said the deal would represent a risk to America's national and economic security.US Steel — officially the United States Steel Corporation — was founded in 1901, and is one of the largest steel producers in America, with 22,000 employees. It made $15.6 billion in revenue in 2024.Just before he left office in January 2025, former President Joe Biden blocked the company's sale on national security grounds.But President Donald Trump opened a new national security review of the deal, and approved the purchase with an executive order on June 13, clearing the way for Nippon Steel to buy 100% of US Steel's shares.However, a national security agreement gives the US government a ""golden share"" that grants it the right to appoint one of the company's directors, and gives the president veto power over certain company decisions, including decisions to move production overseas.Historically, golden shares have been used by governments to try to keep control when privatizing companies — and to keep them from being taken over by foreign entities. Golden shares typically grant their holder the power to block changes to a company's management.However, USW said US Steel's golden share gives Trump ""a startling degree of personal power over a corporation.""The deal also gives Nippon Steel access to US markets while foreign competitors face 50% tariffs on steel.Nippon Steel has promised that US Steel's headquarters will remain in Pittsburgh, and that the majority of its board will be US citizens.

More than that, 59% said controlling their working hours was even more important than getting a higher salary!Randstad surveyed people in seven countries, including the US, Japan, Australia, Italy, Germany, Poland and the UK.And while people seem to be saying that flexible working hours are more important than a flexible work location, half of the workers still said they would give up a higher salary to be able to work from home — and 53% said they would give up promotions!Workers are also very protective of their mental health, with 60% saying they would choose to do less stressful work over getting a higher salary — and that rose to 72% in Japan.

And when choosing between employability and a job that excites them, 59% again chose employability.People in Australia were the most willing to give up remote work for employability, and those in Japan were the most willing to give up an exciting job.","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on the results of the Randstad survey?2.Do many of the people you know have flexible working schedules?3.Which is more important to you: flexible working hours or the ability to work from home?4.Would you give up a raise or promotion to be able to work remotely?5.What do you do to keep yourself skilled, relevant and employable?","Exercise 4Further Discussion Have a discussion based on the following questions.1.What would your ideal working arrangements be?2.Do you think job security is more important than having a job that excites you?3.Would you say it's more important to earn a lot of money or to feel less stressed at work?4.Do you feel that your job offers a good work-life balance? 5.When was the last time you took a day off work?

That app lets people buy cheap leftover food from local restaurants and grocery stores.Like the food app, Basch's new Poppins app helps people find items they need from people or businesses in their area. The idea is people can save money and space by renting things when they need them, instead of having to buy and keep them.It's also good for the planet, because by making more use of fewer things, we can reduce waste and save resources.And of course, people with things they're not using can make some money renting them out — or they can be kind and share them for free!Poppins was launched in France in April. It will be launched in Belgium in 2026, and in the UK in either 2026 or 2027.","Exercise 3QuestionsAnswer the following questions about the article.1.What apps has Lucie Basch founded? 2.When was Poppins launched in France? 3.What other countries will Poppins be available in over the next few years?","Exercise 4DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on Poppins? 2.Do you think an app like this would be popular where you live? 3.Would you feel comfortable renting your things to someone you don't know?4.Do you have anything at home that you bought but almost never use?5.Have you ever regretted not buying something?"

Those tourists brought plenty of money to the country, with favorable tax rules encouraging them to shop.Foreign visitors don't have to pay Japan's 10% consumption tax on products costing more than 5,000 yen — about $34.This isn't available at all stores, but it's a perk that many shops offer — and signs on the windows tempt shoppers inside!Visitors may claim their tax refund at a separate desk at the store, or they may just get it at the counter when they pay.Tourists aren't supposed to use those products in the country, however, and they may have to show their products at customs when they leave Japan.But now some Japanese lawmakers want these tax benefits to end.""We shouldn't make low prices our key selling point,"" said Kenji Nakanishi, a lawmaker from the Liberal Democratic Party. ""I want foreign tourists to understand the true value of Japan, I don't want them to come just because it's cheap.""Others believe that some visitors take advantage of the rules by buying tax-free products and reselling them for a profit inside the country.That will become more difficult from November 2026, when customers won't be able to claim refunds at stores — they'll have to claim them at the airport on departure.However, Nakanishi believes that completely abolishing tax-free shopping would have little impact on tourism.And some tourists agree. Speaking to The Japan Times, one tourist from the US said, ""I think people would come and buy anyway even if there was no tax-free system.""Some have also argued that it's unfair that tourists are able to get good deals on some products while local residents struggle with rising costs of living.But Masahiro Ohmoto, from the Japan Tax-Free Shop Association, worries that abolishing tax-free shopping would make people more likely to spend their money in neighboring countries.","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on the calls for Japan to abolish tax-free shopping?2.How do you think abolishing tax-free shopping would impact tourism in Japan? 3.Do you agree that it's unfair that tourists don't have to pay taxes on products while locals do?4.What do you imagine are Japan's key selling points for tourists?5.What are some of the best things you've bought on your travels?","Exercise 4Further Discussion Have a discussion based on the following questions.1.Is your area popular with tourists?

Rather, social and economic pressures — including rising living costs, gender inequality and worries about the future — are stopping them from having the number of kids they want.UNFPA surveyed 14,000 people across 14 countries:  South Korea, Thailand, Italy, Hungary, Germany, Sweden, Brazil, Mexico, US, India, Indonesia, Morocco, South Africa and Nigeria. The countries are a mix of low, middle and high-income countries and those with lower and higher birth rates. Together, they represent around 37% of the world's population.The survey found that economic problems were the biggest concern, with 39% saying financial worries were their reason for having fewer children than they'd like. This number increased to 58% in South Korea, the highest of all the surveyed countries. It was lowest in Sweden at just 19%.The next biggest issues were job insecurity, named by 21%, and fears about the future — concerns about things like climate change, pandemics and war — were named by 19%. Unequal division of domestic work was cited as stopping 13% of women from having the number of kids they want, although only 8% of men shared this worry.The report says that one in four people now live in a country where the population is thought to have reached its peak.

A built-in microphone will also allow chatting with other gamers.The presentation started with an extended look at Mario Kart World which has a knockout game mode and the ability to grind on rails skateboard-style while racing.The developer also unveiled a new James Bond game, dubbed Project 007, and two more Switch 2 exclusives. Donkey Kong Bananza, a 3D adventure with the big ape punching his way through a huge underground world, arrives July 17. Kirby Air Riders, a racing game from the director of the Super Smash Bros. series, is due later in the year.The new console will be able to play physical and digital Switch games — but users will need to purchase a microSD express memory card for the Switch 2. The presentation revealed that normal microSD cards will not be compatible with the system. However, data from the original Switch can be transferred to the new console.The Switch 2's $449.99 launch price is significantly higher than the original Switch's $299 price tag. Buying the console with the new Mario Kart game included will cost $499.99.Experts say that the high price is due to President Donald Trump's tariffs. The tariffs impact games hardware because console devices are manufactured and shipped from China and the Asian region at large.Nintendo plans to host ""Switch 2 Experience"" events in several countries, where gamers can get a hands-on experience with the new system.

But for some people, water is not a place of freedom — it is a place of fear.Some may have bad memories of the sea, others worry about not being able to stand up.But experts say this fear is something that can be overcome.Writing for The Guardian,  swimming teacher Jane Greene Pettersson says the fear of ""letting go"" is something that many people find hard — you can't hold on to water.When she is working with people who are new to swimming, she asks them to start by getting their faces wet.Children who are starting swimming lessons are often asked to blow bubbles when they put their faces in the water, to show them that when you breathe out you won't get water in your mouth.Adults might also like to try this.Others ask people to sit on the side of a pool, put their feet in and move them around a little to get a feel for the water.If this works, another step might be climbing down the pool ladder and into the water, while still holding on to the ladder.One of the things that the UK's National Health Service advises with any fear is to breathe slowly and deeply. This is very important with swimming because we need to be as calm as possible to stay safe.So, it's a good idea to begin in the shallow end of the pool and perhaps to choose a time when the pool is not busy.Even some Olympic swimmers were afraid of water as children. It might be too late for us to make it to the Olympics, but we're never too old to overcome our fears!","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.Do you know anyone who has a fear of swimming?2.Are you a good swimmer?

These hobbies can actually help your mind and body feel better.Emma Palmer-Cooper, a psychologist from the UK, told Good Housekeeping that having small goals, like learning a new hobby or finishing a project, gives us a sense of purpose. When we reach those goals, we feel happy and proud. This helps improve our mood and mental health.Science backs this up. A 2020 study from Princeton University found that gardening makes people feel as happy as eating at a restaurant or going for a walk. Another study from Kansas State University in 2009 showed that gardening helps older adults feel better about themselves.Bird-watching is another great activity. A 2022 study found that seeing or hearing birds can improve your mood — even for people with depression.Drawing is also a fun and creative way to help your mental health. Research has shown that just 10 minutes of drawing a day can lift your mood. And if you keep doing it for a month, the effects are even stronger.These hobbies don't just improve your mental health, either — experts say they also keep your brain healthy.When you learn something new, like knitting, your brain becomes more active.

This mix of smooth and crispy textures has made it a must-try for sweet lovers everywhere.And this chocolate bar doesn't just taste good — it also looks beautiful, often decorated with melted pistachio chocolate drizzled over the top.The original Dubai chocolate was created in 2021 by Sarah Hamouda, a British-Egyptian woman living in Dubai. But she wasn't a chef — she was an engineer.While she was pregnant with her second child, she started craving something sweet and nutty. That's when she had the idea to put chocolate together with Middle Eastern flavors.With help from a chef, she experimented until she found the perfect recipe, and she launched her chocolate brand, Fix Dessert Chocolatier, in 2023.At first, the chocolate stayed under the radar. But everything changed when TikTok influencer Maria Vehera posted a video of herself eating some Fix Dessert bars. The video went viral, reaching over 100 million views, and suddenly everyone wanted to try Dubai chocolate.Today, shops and supermarkets around the world are making their own versions of Dubai chocolate. But the original Fix Dessert bars are only sold in the United Arab Emirates, and only a small number are made each day.This, experts say, is what makes the chocolate so popular — because it's so hard to find.Dubai chocolate is hard to make in large amounts, because the knafeh inside is very crispy and fragile. Keeping its crunch while adding creamy filling and coating it in chocolate takes a lot of care, so large factories would need advanced machines to get it just right.Food trend expert Alon Chen says this is what makes Dubai chocolate so special.""Without the crunchiness, it's just another pistachio-flavored chocolate bar,"" he told The Guardian.","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.Have you tried Dubai chocolate?

This is the only museum in Japan that has one of these cameras.Some of the cameras can be picked up so you can look at how they were used, and some models have been cut in half so you can see their inner workings.There's also a fun ""detective camera"" section, with cameras disguised as things like drinks cans or walking sticks!And because the museum is always showing different items from its collection, it promises ""a new discovery at every visit.""Right now, visitors to the museum can see an exhibition about the development of Japanese cameras during the early part of Japan's Showa era, from 1926 to 1954.","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on the JCII Camera Museum?

The research team then used artificial intelligence to look at the data.They found that there were some ""clear tipping points"" that distinguished a ""good"" day from a typical one.Spending a lot of time relaxing actually wasn't always associated with having a better day.But spending time with friends was found to be very likely to have a really positive effect on someone's day.

It's being used in schools, offices, music and movies.Even the Oscars are changing because of AI.The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has updated its rules, saying films that use AI are now allowed to win awards. So even if a movie uses AI to help with writing, editing or voices, it can still win Hollywood's biggest prize.The Academy explained that using AI will not help or hurt a film's chances of getting nominated, although human creativity and input are still the things that matter most.The use of AI in film became a talking point after this year's Oscars, when Adrien Brody won Best Actor for his work in The Brutalist.In the film, both Brody and his co-star Felicity Jones had to speak Hungarian, a very difficult language to pronounce. According to the film's editor David Jancso, AI was used to perfect their speech.""They did a fabulous job,"" he told Red Shark News, ""but we also wanted to perfect it so that not even locals will spot any difference.""Another Oscar-winning film, the musical Emilia Perez, used AI to improve the singing of the actors.The use of AI is becoming more common in the film and music industries. But not everyone is happy about it.During the 2023 Hollywood strikes, many actors and writers spoke out about AI, saying they were worried it could take away their jobs.

If Leonardo walked in the same direction every day, that's about 6 meters of walking per day.When he was found, he was taken to a pet shop called Little Beasties, where the staff were able to find his owners.In an online post, Little Beasties said the owners ""couldn't believe it when they heard the news and were really pleased he was found safe and healthy.""One of his owners, Rachel Etches, told the BBC that the day Leonardo went missing she'd been a bit distracted in the garden because they had just had their second child.""He's led a very comfortable life for 13 years under a heat lamp in my house, so we didn't think he was going to survive the winter being out for the first time,"" she said.She added that she thinks he must have gone into hibernation during the coldest months, and then started walking again when the weather got better.","Exercise 3QuestionsAnswer the following questions about the article.1.What town did Leonardo start walking from?

There, visitors can view artworks in open storage without the usual barriers, giving a behind-the-scenes look at how art is kept and handled.The museum said there are some small scratches in the lower part of the painting, where the paint is not covered by varnish.Experts say that paintings like Rothko's are difficult to protect because they don't have a traditional coating, so even small marks are easy to make.

It used social media, worked with influencers and had party members go on podcasts — and unveiled a Labubu doll wearing the party uniform.Labubu is a monster with big eyes and ears, sharp teeth and a very wide smile. With her furry body, she looks almost like a rabbit with a big human face.The toys are loved for being both ugly and cute at the same time, and have gone viral.The character is part of Chinese company Pop Mart's The Monsters range. Pop Mart releases sets of the toys with different themes.For example, in the recent Big Into Energy series, the dolls come in different colors representing things like love, happiness and luck.However, each 17-centimeter-tall toy comes in a ""blind box.""

Lung designed Labubu in 2015 for a series of  picture books.The toys came out in 2019, but it's only been recently that they've become a huge trend — even finding celebrity fans. In April, K-pop star Lisa from Blackpink told Teen Vogue, ""Labubu is my baby.""

But the reason for the race was to raise awareness about the risk of cheetahs becoming an endangered species.The rugby player started 50 meters ahead of the cheetah, but got to the finish at about the same time as the animal — because while Habana was fast, humans just can't compete with many animals!There are a number of reasons for this. There's evolution, of course, and the fact that many animals have four legs, as well as their running style and the shapes of their bodies.So which land animals are the fastest?The cheetah is famous for being the world's fastest land animal. It has a top speed of around 114 kilometers per hour. However, it can only run fast over short distances — about 400 meters.According to the Conservation Africa website, they're fast because they're quite light, and they have flexible spines, small heads and long legs.The next fastest land animal is the pronghorn, or American antelope, which can run at speeds of almost 90 kilometers per hour. Pronghorns are very light, with large hearts and lungs that make them strong runners. Pronghorns can actually keep going at high speeds longer than cheetahs can!The springbok, the national animal of South Africa — its rugby team is known as the Springboks — can run at a similar speed, while gazelles and wildebeest are only a little slower.But Britannica says there's another important reason why many animals are so good at running fast: they have to be.They spend a lot more time running after prey — or running away from predators — than humans do!","Exercise 3QuestionsAnswer the following questions about the article.1.How long was the race between Brian Habana and the cheetah? 2.How far can a cheetah run at top speed? 3.How fast can a pronghorn run?","Exercise 4DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on the world's fastest land animals? 2.Have you seen any of these animals in person?

But only a small percentage rely on these practices to make major decisions.That's according to a nationwide survey of 9,593 US adults released on May 21 by the Pew Research Center.According to Pew, about 20% of US adults say they engage in such activities mostly ""just for fun,"" while about 10% say they engage because they ""believe the practices give them helpful insights.""  Only about 1% say they rely ""a lot"" on what they learn from these practices when making major life decisions.Yet it's a big business.

According to Pew, about 40% of women aged 18 to 49 say they believe in astrology. That compares with about 30% of women aged 50 and older and about 20% of men under age 50.According to the survey, about half of LGBTQ+ adults use astrology or a horoscope at least yearly. Pew found that about 20% of LGBTQ+ adults say that when they make major life decisions, they rely at least ""a little"" on what they've learned from psychic services.However, adults aged 65 or older, those with high incomes and college degrees, and those who identify as politically conservative are less likely than other adults to believe or engage in psychic services.According to IBIS World, the psychic services industry's total revenue has increased by more than 4% annually since the start of the coronavirus pandemic five years ago, ""when business closures, sickness and loss of loved ones"" caused increased demand.IBIS World said personalized reports and virtual readings were becoming popular with younger consumers thanks to ""easy access via mobile apps and social media platforms.""","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on Pew's findings?2.Do you find it surprising that so many Americans make use of astrology, tarot and fortune tellers?3.Are you into astrology?

It's an annual series of parades and other events to celebrate LGBTQ+ culture and rights. At its heart, Pride is both a party and a protest.The global celebration began with Gay Pride Week in late June 1970, a year after a violent police raid at New York's Stonewall Inn, a gay bar. At a time when many LGBTQ+ people kept their identities private, the June 28, 1969, raid led to a series of public protests and catalyzed the gay rights movement.The first Pride week included marches in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York and San Francisco, and it has since grown to other cities. There are now Pride celebrations around the world too, including in Tokyo on June 8; Toronto on June 27-29, and Paris on June 28.Some events are outside of June. World Pride, which happens every two years, is being held in Washington, D.C. It began in May and continues until June 8. Pride in London is in July and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, celebrates in November.In the US, Pride 2025 is taking place soon after the introduction of new policies that limit freedoms for transgender people and that try to end diversity programs in government, education and businesses. Pride organizers across the country have reported that corporate sponsors have pulled out of their events.But one thing that is likely to be celebrated is the 10th anniversary of the US Supreme Court ruling that recognized same-sex marriage. About two-thirds of LGBTQ+ adults in the US said the ruling made the nation more accepting of same-sex couples, according to a Pew Research Center survey released last week.The survey found that LGBTQ+ people still don't always feel accepted, though. About six in 10 said they see ""a great deal"" or ""a fair amount"" of social acceptance for those who are lesbian, gay or bisexual. But only about one in 10 said the same is true for nonbinary and transgender people.","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.How much did you know about Pride Month before reading this article?2.How big are Pride events in your country?

The court is smaller than a tennis court and is surrounded by walls made of glass.Padel uses the same points system as tennis, but the rules are different.Similarly to squash, players can hit the ball off the walls during the game, but the ball must bounce once on the ground before it can touch any other surface. If the ball hits another surface before bouncing on the ground, it's out.The sport started in 1969 in Mexico, after a man named Enrique Corcuera created the first padel court at his home. He liked tennis, but he didn't have enough space for a full-size tennis court. His wife, Viviana, wrote the first rules for the game and gave them to her husband as a birthday present.In the 1970s, Prince Alfonso of Spain visited Corcuera's home and liked the game so much that he built padel courts at a hotel he owned in Spain. Around the same time, Julio Menditeguy, a member of the prince's tennis club, took the game back to his home country of Argentina.From there, the sport grew quickly in South America and Europe.By the 1980s, padel reached more countries like Brazil, France and the US, and the first international match took place in 1988 between Spain and Argentina. In 1991, the International Padel Federation was created, and the first World Padel Championship was held the year after.Today, padel is played in over 140 countries by about 30 million players.

That's 18-year-old Prince Hisahito, the only son of Prince Akishino and Princess Kiko. Emperor Naruhito only has a daughter, Princess Aiko.At times, support for a female emperor has been as high as almost 90%. And the current lower figure of 70% could be linked to Hisahito entering adulthood.Some hope that Aiko might one day become empress, and the 23-year-old has been doing some official duties.However, Japanese law says that if a female member of the royal family marries someone who is not a royal, they themselves are no longer considered a royal.This means their children, whether male or female, are not considered heirs to the throne.The survey also found that 66% of Japanese people are interested in the royal family.

But have you ever thought they might be … linked, somehow?Well, the ""Pixar Theory"" is a fan-made idea that links every Pixar movie into one big story.It was first introduced in 2013 by Jon Negroni, who said the characters, worlds and stories in each film may actually be part of a single timeline.The timeline begins with The Good Dinosaur, a movie that's set in a world where the asteroid that was supposed to kill the dinosaurs misses the Earth. Because of this, dinosaurs have time to learn to farm, raise families, and show feelings like love. This is one of the first signs of animals becoming more like humans in Pixar's world.Next is the movie Brave, where a witch uses magic to turn people into animals — and also makes objects act like people.

That's not surprising, because the number is mentioned in the title of this article!But actually, when asked to pick a random number between one and 100, people often choose 37 or 73.Veritasium, a science and education YouTube channel, explored this odd trend in a video called, Why is this number everywhere?In the video, 200,000 people picked random numbers, with seven, 37, 73 and 77 chosen most often.Next, they guessed which numbers others would pick the least. After obvious choices like 1, 2, 99, 100 and 50, the next most common guesses were 37 and 73.However, the actual least chosen number was 90, followed by 30, 40, 70, 80 and 60.So why are 37 and 73 such popular ""random"" numbers? It might be how we perceive ""randomness,"" the video said.Odd numbers feel more random than even numbers. But five doesn't feel random because it's in the middle, and one and nine feel too extreme. That leaves three and seven.And 37 and 73 are prime numbers, meaning they can only be divided by one and themselves. This makes them feel even rarer to us.Despite this, the number 37 actually shows up more than you might think.For example, our average body temperature is about 37 degrees Celsius. And in the Bible, it's written that Jesus performed 37 miracles.There's also the 37% rule, which says that, when given many choices, we should reject the first 37% of our options. These rejections help us discover what will be important to us in making a final decision. After that, if any option looks good to us, we should choose it right away and ignore the rest.So choosing 37 as a ""random number"" might not actually be as random as you think!","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.Did it surprise you that 37 is often chosen as a random number?2.Are the numbers 3 or 7 significant in your culture?3.Are there any numbers that show up a lot in your culture?4.Are you a big believer in randomness or chance?5.Do you know of any other odd numerical phenomena or trends?","Exercise 4Further Discussion Have a discussion based on the following questions.1.Do you follow any science and education YouTube channels?2.What branches of science do you find most interesting?3.Were you good at maths at school?4.Do you have to be good at maths for your job?5.I believe life is an intelligent thing, that things aren't random. — Steve Jobs.

But did you know that the game has its own world championships?The World Minigolf Sport Federation (WMF), based in Germany, has organized world championships every two years for the game since 2003, with athletes of all ages competing from all over the world.A tournament minigolf course has 18 ""lanes,"" with each ""lane"" including obstacles that players must get their ball over, under, around or through. And just like in regular golf, players try to finish the course in as few shots as possible — with a perfect minigolf tournament score being 18 shots.While the course may be miniature, the game requires a huge amount of skill, just like any sport. Pat Sheridan, media manager of the WMF, describes the sport as taking the most precise skill of golf — putting — and adding the mental challenges of a chess match.""It goes beyond the family fun you might have on a minigolf course on vacation without losing its roots in that activity,"" he told us.One other thing that makes minigolf different from regular golf is how easy it is to begin playing. Sheridan explains that regardless of age and gender, everyone's equal when on a minigolf course.But top athletes often need to stand, bend and putt for eight or more hours a day during practice or tournament days, Sheridan says, adding, ""It may be an easy sport to get into but like any sport it's hard to make your way to the top and keep yourself there.""When we asked if minigolf deserves a place in global sports competitions, Sheridan replied: ""Absolutely.

But we often have one rule for ourselves, and another for other people.For example, if we're at a restaurant and our friend's food comes first, we'll often say, ""Go ahead, eat!""  But if our own food arrives early, we'll probably feel we should wait.A new study explains why we hold ourselves to stricter standards than others.Researchers from the UK and the Netherlands did six experiments with almost 2,000 people, mostly in the US. In each test, people imagined a meal with a friend. Sometimes they got their food first, other times their friend did.When they had to imagine themselves getting food first, most people said they should wait before eating. But when they imagined their friend getting food first, they said it was OK for the friend to eat right away.The researchers said this happens because of something called a ""self-other difference.""  We feel our own emotions, such as guilt or awkwardness, very strongly, but we can't fully grasp what others are feeling.When we are the ones eating first, we feel guilt or worry, and we think we might look rude or selfish. But when someone else is in the same situation, we assume they are fine, even if they are not.Even when people were asked to think about how their friend might feel, the results didn't change much. Nor did they change when people were told they had permission to eat first.This shows the problem isn't just about rules or social expectations — it comes from the way the human mind works. We see our own discomfort clearly, but we don't fully notice it in others.So when you tell a friend, ""Go ahead, eat!"" just remember — you might not feel as comfortable if the roles are reversed!","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on the study's findings?2.Is it considered rude in your country to eat before everyone is served?3.How would you feel if someone started eating before your food arrived?4.What are some of the most important table rules in your country?5.Have you noticed any big cultural differences in table manners when traveling?","Exercise 4Further Discussion Have a discussion based on the following questions.1.How often do you eat out?

So he traveled around Canada and the US to see how different organizations were trying to help the homeless.He decided that building communities of tiny homes was the best way to help, since they can be built quickly while providing a safe and affordable place to live.LeBrun began by building a community of 96 houses in the city of Fredericton, New Brunswick. He put his own money into the project and also received government grants.The ""12 Neighbours Community"" now provides subsidized housing for people who were previously homeless. Each tiny home has a kitchen, a bathroom, a living room that is also used as a bedroom, and solar panels on the roof.A home in the 12 Neighbours Community costs nearly $60,000 to build, while the average price of affordable housing in Canada is about $255,000.The community also has gardens, shops, a cafe, and workshops where residents can learn new skills. LeBrun sees giving residents the opportunity to work as an important part of helping them become independent.And LeBrun isn't finished.His next project, called ""Neighbourly Homes,"" aims to provide housing that can be built more quickly, as it's needed. This would only be temporary housing, but these units could be built in a day at a cost of only around $5,500 each.These units would each have a bed, a desk, a tablet and access to shared bathrooms.In May, the city of Saint John, New Brunswick, already announced that it is planning to build two communities with 27 Neighbourly Homes in each.","Exercise 3QuestionsAnswer the following questions about the article.1.How many tiny homes did Marcel LeBrun first build in Fredericton?2.How much does a home in the 12 Neighbours Community cost? 3.How quickly can a tiny home in Neighbourly Homes be built?","Exercise 4DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on Marcel LeBrun's housing projects? 2.Are tiny homes popular in your country?

Fleming created the famous secret agent James Bond, known as 007.Fleming died in 1964, when only the first three Bond films — with Sean Connery as 007 — had been released. But the character lives on to this day.So who was the man behind the spy?Ian Fleming was born into a rich family in London in 1908. But his father died in World War I when Ian was a child.Ian first went to school in England, then went to university in Austria, Switzerland and Germany. He later worked as a writer in Moscow and in a London bank.But it was during wartime that he's likely to have gotten the idea for Bond. He's said to have based the character on a number of people he met during World War II, when he worked as an intelligence officer in the British navy.Bond was first seen in the 1953 novel Casino Royale, which Fleming wrote while at his summer house in Jamaica. The name of the house was ""Goldeneye,"" which would also become the title of a 1995 Bond movie.By the time he died at age 56, Fleming had written 12 Bond novels and two collections of short stories. They quickly became popular — even US President John F. Kennedy said he enjoyed them.There was more to Fleming than just 007, however. He also wrote the children's story Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, which was made into a popular movie in 1968.But he will always be associated with his British spy — and the movies that still make hundreds of millions of dollars around the world.Bronze bust of Fleming by sculptor Anthony Smith.","Exercise 3QuestionsAnswer the following questions about the article.1.Where did Fleming go to university?2.In which novel did James Bond first appear?3.When did Ian Fleming die?","Exercise 4DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.Did you know much about Ian Fleming before reading this article?2.Are you a fan of the James Bond films?

They can actually help reduce stress, at least in the body, even when the games are intense or violent.The game used in the study was A Plague Tale: Requiem. It's a dark, story-based game that has many intense and stressful scenes, so it's not the kind of game you'd usually think of as relaxing.To start, researchers made participants feel stressed by asking them to put their hand in ice-cold water for three minutes. This is known to cause a strong stress reaction, and the researchers made sure everyone started the study feeling the same level of stress.After that, participants were split into two groups. One group played two violent scenes from the game, and the other group played two non-violent ones. Both groups played for about 25 minutes.While they played, the researchers checked their heart rates and stress hormones, and asked how they felt.People who played the violent scenes said they felt more stressed and less relaxed. But physically, both groups had similar reactions — their heart rates and stress hormones went down.Many gamers say that playing video games helps them feel calmer and more in control. However, the effects of gaming are not always positive.Playing too much can lead to problems with sleep, relationships and other responsibilities. And while online games can help people feel less lonely, they can also expose players to bullying or toxic behavior, which can increase stress.So while gaming isn't a perfect solution for everyone, this study suggests that even stressful games might help the body relax.","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on the study's findings? 2.Do you play a lot of video games?

Splashdown occurred off the coast of Tallahassee in the Florida Panhandle.Within an hour, the astronauts were out of their capsule, waving and smiling at the cameras while being taken away for routine medical checks.It all started with a Boeing test flight last spring.The two expected to be gone just a week or so after launching on Boeing's new Starliner crew capsule on June 5. But so many problems occurred on the way to the space station that NASA eventually sent Starliner back empty and transferred the test pilots to SpaceX, pushing their homecoming to February. Then SpaceX capsule issues added another month's delay.The arrival of their relief crew on March 16, meant Wilmore and Williams could finally leave. They left with NASA's Nick Hague and Russia's Alexander Gorbunov, who had arrived in their own SpaceX capsule last fall.Wilmore and Williams ended up spending 286 days in space — 278 days longer than originally planned. They circled Earth 4,576 times and traveled 195 million kilometers by the time of splashdown.""On behalf of SpaceX, welcome home,"" radioed SpaceX Mission Control in California.""What a ride,"" replied Hague, the capsule's commander. ""I see a capsule full of grins ear to ear.""Dolphins circled the capsule as divers readied it for hoisting onto the recovery ship. Once safely on board, the side hatch was opened and the astronauts were helped out, one by one.NASA has hired SpaceX and Boeing to transport astronauts to and from the space station until it's abandoned in 2030. By then, it will have been up there for more than three decades; the plan is to replace it with privately run stations so NASA can focus on moon and Mars expeditions.","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on the astronauts' return to Earth?2.What do you imagine it would be like to spend 286 days in space? 3.Have you ever had to stay somewhere longer than you originally planned?4.What's the first thing you'd do upon returning home after a year-long absence?5.Do you think it's a good idea to replace the International Space Station with privately run stations?","Exercise 4Further Discussion Have a discussion based on the following questions.1.If you could ask Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams anything about their time in space, what would it be?2.What fascinates you most about space exploration? 3.Do you think space tourism will become affordable within your lifetime?4.Do you think you'll live to see a human mission to Mars?5.Astronauts are the closest thing we have to superheroes. — Unknown.

No, this was the name of the controversial ball those players would be using.It was controversial because quite a lot of players said it was too unpredictable — they didn't know what it would do in the air, especially when it was kicked hard.Brazilian goalkeeper Julio Cesar called it ""horrible.""So what was the problem with the ball?Soccer balls are supposed to be round, but this one — made by Adidas — was said to be the roundest ever made.Some older balls had stitches that you could see on the outside, but not the Jabulani.This meant it was very round. And the outside of the ball was also very smooth.The smoothness of a soccer ball affects how air moves around it when it's kicked. A smooth ball has a surface that lets air flow evenly at first, but as the ball goes faster, the air can suddenly become unstable and separate from the ball.When the air separates, the ball's movement can become unpredictable, making it wobble. It does this when it gets to something called its ""critical speed.""NASA even tested the Jabulani ball and found that it got to its critical speed at about 80 kilometers per hour, which is about the speed of a hard shot by a soccer player.When it was hit hard, it was more likely to wobble. That's why Brazil's goalkeeper was worried!Since 2010, scientists have made the balls less smooth, and more predictable.  And players have stopped complaining — well, about the ball, at least!","Exercise 3QuestionsAnswer the following questions about the article.1.Who made the Jabulani ball?2.What happens when the air around a soccer ball separates?3.At what speed did the Jabulani ball reach its critical speed?","Exercise 4DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on the Jabulani ball?2.Do you follow soccer?

On a Raft!How did iguanas get to Fiji?It sounds like the start of a joke, but no, it's a question that scientists have been asking for a number of years.Most iguanas live in the Americas — thousands of kilometers across the ocean from the islands of Fiji in the Pacific.Scientists thought they may have traveled to Fiji through Asia and Australia before volcanic activity pushed the land apart.But new research suggests that millions of years ago, iguanas made the 8,000-kilometer trip on a raft!They believe the animals traveled on floating trees and plants. Their journey is thought to be a record — it's further than any other land-living vertebrate has ever traveled on the ocean in this way.Scientists think that's how iguanas got to the Galapagos Islands near Ecuador and between islands in the Caribbean.At first, they thought Fiji might be a bit too far for such a trip, but in a new study, researchers looked at the genes of 14 iguana species from the Americas, the Caribbean and Fiji.They discovered that Fijian iguanas were most closely related to desert iguanas from North America, and that the two groups split off around 31 million years ago.After they'd looked at the data with the help of a statistical model and other information, they decided that the most likely answer to their question was that the iguanas floated to Fiji from North America.That journey could have taken a few months, but these desert iguanas would have been good passengers because they don't need a lot of water and they could have eaten the plants they were traveling on.Scientists said that finding out more about the iguanas' past can help protect them in the future.","Exercise 3QuestionsAnswer the following questions about the article.1.What do scientists believe Fijian iguanas traveled on?2.What species of iguanas are Fijian iguanas most closely related to?3.How long do scientists think the iguanas' journey to Fiji could have taken?","Exercise 4DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on this discovery?2.Have you ever seen an iguana up close? 3.How would you feel about keeping an iguana as a pet?4.What reptiles are commonly found in your country?5.What are some of the most surprising animal facts you've learned?"

Self-Cooling Can Chills in MinutesThere's nothing better than an ice-cold drink on a hot day. But when you're outside, keeping drinks cold isn't easy. Ice melts, coolers are heavy, and your refrigerator is probably far away.Wouldn't it be great if your drink could just chill itself?Well, the Cool Can can do just that!The Cool Can is a self-cooling can invented by James Vyse of Wales, who used to work as a bartender. He never studied engineering, but he spent years experimenting to create a can that chills a drink in minutes.The Cool Can works by pushing a button on the bottom of the can. The outside of the can gets colder right away, and after a few minutes, the drink inside is ice cold too.This works because of a special layer of crystals inside the can's walls. When you push the button, water is released, which mixes with the crystals. This creates a reaction that absorbs heat, making the drink inside cold.As well as being easy to use, the Cool Can could also help reduce the need for refrigerators, which use 17% of the world's electricity, according to the United Nations. Plus, unlike plastic bottles, aluminum cans are easy to recycle, and the Cool Can can be recycled just like any other can.The idea is already quite popular. A survey of 100 university students by Vyse's company, Delta H Innovations, found that 81% would choose a self-cooling can over a normal one when drinking on the go, while 73% would be happy to pay more if it meant their drink was cold.Vyse is already talking to drink companies like Coca-Cola and Red Bull, and if all goes well, his cans could be on sale by 2026.","Exercise 3QuestionsAnswer the following questions about the article.1.Who invented the Cool Can?2.How much of the world's electricity do refrigerators use?3.When could the Cool Can be on sale?","Exercise 4DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on the Cool Can?2.Do you find it surprising that James Vyse has no engineering experience?3.Do you think you'd find self-cooling cans useful?4.Do you think the Cool Can will be popular?5.What are some of your favorite cold drinks?"

But a group of researchers from Finland believes there may actually be many billions more people on Earth.In a study published this March in Nature Communications, they said that previous population estimates could have been off by as much as 84%!They said that this was most likely to have happened because of poor population estimates in rural areas, where it's hard to know how many people actually live.Of course, counting people isn't easy for a lot of different reasons.Many estimates use something called ""gridded population data.""This divides the world into grids, with estimates made for each grid square based on census data and other information.But the researchers said this works better in towns and cities than it does in rural areas.They compared the data used from these large datasets with other, smaller datasets taken in 35 countries around the world.These smaller datasets only looked at population numbers for people who had been moved from their homes so that dams could be built.These numbers were thought to be more reliable because dam companies had paid for the people to be moved.When the researchers compared the datasets, they found a lot of differences, which suggested that the global population estimates that are used around the world every day are likely to be much smaller than the real number.It's very important to have accurate information, they said, so governments can provide services for people in rural areas.","Exercise 3QuestionsAnswer the following questions about the article.1.By how much did the researchers say previous population estimates might have been off?2.How does gridded population data work?3.Why did the researchers look at population data from areas where people were moved for dam construction?","Exercise 4DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on the findings of this study?2.Are you surprised that population estimates could be off by as much as 84%?3.How accurate do you imagine population data is in your country?4.What's the population of your country?

Maybe it's your first day of school, a birthday party, or a favorite toy.Most people can't remember anything from before they were 3 or 4 years old. This phenomenon is called ""infantile amnesia.""For a long time, scientists thought this happened because babies' brains weren't ready to make memories. They believed the hippocampus — the part of the brain that helps store memories — wasn't yet developed enough.But a new study from Yale University has found something that challenges this idea.In the study, researchers showed babies pictures of faces, objects and scenes. Later, they showed a picture the baby had seen before next to a new one. If the baby looked longer at the familiar image, the researchers said it meant they remembered it.The researchers found that the more active the hippocampus was when the baby first saw an image, the more likely the baby was to remember it later. This hippocampus activity was stronger in babies over 1 year old, but it was present in all of them.This means the ability to create memories may start much earlier than we used to think.So if our brains are capable of making memories from a young age, why don't we remember being babies?Well, scientists still aren't sure.One idea is that the memories babies make are only short-term, which is why we can't remember them as adults.Another theory suggests the memories are still in our brains — we just lose the ability to access them. Nick Turk-Browne, who led the study, says infantile amnesia may not be about being unable to make memories, but about being unable to retrieve them later.So, memories of your first words or first steps might still be locked away in your brain somewhere — you just can't find the key!","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on the findings of this study?2.Do you find it surprising that our brains are capable of making memories from a young age?3.What are some of your earliest childhood memories?4.Would you say that you have a good memory? 5.If it were possible, would you want to have access to all your early memories?","Exercise 4Further Discussion Have a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are some memories that always make you smile?2.Do you know anyone with an exceptionally good memory?3.Do you have any tips or techniques for memorizing things?4.What do you find most fascinating about the human brain?5.Memory is deceptive because it is colored by today's events. — Albert Einstein.

The report says that this is enough plastic to fill the stomachs of 18 million blue whales.Oceana made its estimates using Coca-Cola's own reported data on its use of plastic packaging between 2018 and 2023, and a forecast of the company's future sales growth based on past trends.A 2024 study found that Coca-Cola is already the world's worst plastic-polluting brand.Oceana says the problem is Coca-Cola's use of single-use plastic instead of reusable packaging. Reusable bottles can be used up to 25 times if made of thicker plastic, and up to 50 times if made of glass.Coca-Cola previously had a goal of using 25% reusable packaging by 2030, but announced that it had given up that goal at the end of 2024.Instead, the company says it will increase the use of recycled plastic in its packaging and increase collection of single-use plastic bottles for further recycling.However, Oceana says that relying on the use of recycled materials and collection of plastic for recycling won't reduce the impact of Coca-Cola's plastic use.Oceana's Senior Vice President Matt Littlejohn said: ""Single-use plastic is bad for the oceans, human health, and business. Recycling can't solve the company's out-of-control plastic problem. Reuse can.""""Single-use plastic bottles made with recycled content can — just like bottles made of virgin plastic — still become marine pollution and harm ocean life,"" he added.As well as harming sea life, plastic use is also harmful for human health.

For example, journalist Satyen K Bordoloi once asked ChatGPT to tell him the world record for crossing the English channel ""entirely on foot"" — something that's impossible to do.But ChatGPT replied that the record had been set in 2020, with a time of 14 hours and 51 minutes.However, some AI hallucinations can have real consequences — as two New York lawyers found in 2023, when they and their firm were ordered to pay $5,000 for submitting a legal brief that referenced court cases that didn't exist.They had used ChatGPT for research, and didn't check if the cases it listed were real.In other types of hallucinations, AI may also think it sees patterns or even objects that don't actually exist.So why does this happen?Writing for The Conversation, information science students Anna Choi and Katelyn Xiaoying Mei explain that AI systems are made by feeding huge amounts of data into computational systems that look for patterns.How the AI answers questions is based on those patterns. When it doesn't have an answer or know what to do — or doesn't understand the question — it will try to fill in the information with data from similar contexts, even if the resulting answer isn't real or true.AI can be helpful for research, especially when you're looking for ideas on where to start learning about a topic. However, it's important to fact-check what it tells you. For example, ask for references, or check the information yourself using trusted sources.But in the end, it's always important that we humans use our critical thinking skills, and don't just believe that AI is always telling us the truth!","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.Do you find it surprising that AI sometimes shares fake or incorrect information?2.Have you ever gotten a strange answer from an AI chatbot?3.How often do you use AI?

And this watch has an impressive 41 complications — more than any other wristwatch ever made.It was made by Vacheron Constantin, a Swiss company that has been making watches since 1755. The watch took eight years to design and build.It tracks the sun's position in the sky, shows when certain constellations will become visible, and plays a soft chime using miniature gongs. It also shows three types of time: 24-hour time, sidereal time — which is based on Earth's rotation, and is about four minutes shorter than a solar day — and solar time, which changes with the Earth's movement around the sun.What makes this even more impressive is that all of these features are powered by more than 1,500 tiny gears and springs, with no electronics inside the watch at all.Vacheron Constantin is no stranger to the world of record-breaking watchmaking.The company also holds the record for the most complicated pocket watch ever — the Berkley Grand Complication, with 63 features, including a Chinese calendar based on the moon and sun.But pocket watches are much larger, so there's more room to work with.

And the phrase ""to weasel out of something"" can be used when someone doesn't do something they said they were going to do — often by finding a sneaky way to get out of it.They do a 'war dance'When weasels hunt, they aren't just sneaky and quick — they've even been seen doing a ""war dance.""  They jump around and make quick movements, which scientists believe might be a way of confusing their prey before they kill them.They save their leftoversWeasels can eat about half of their weight in 24 hours. And since they're so small, this often means they catch more than they need to eat!So weasels save their leftovers by making holes in the ground near where they sleep — just like a little fridge! This especially helps them in winter, when it's too cold to go outside and hunt.","Exercise 3QuestionsAnswer the following questions about the article.1.How much does the ""least weasel"" weigh?2.Why do weasels do a ""war dance""?3.How much can weasels eat in 24 hours?","Exercise 4DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.Which of the facts about weasels did you find surprising?2.Are weasels commonly found in your country?

China's New 'General AI Agent'In January, the Chinese company DeepSeek released R1, a chatbot that quickly made headlines both for its popularity and for its low cost compared to rival chatbots like ChatGPT.Two months later, another AI product from a Chinese company was hailed as a ""second DeepSeek moment"" by Forbes, saying the product, called Manus, ""changes everything.""So what is Manus?Developed by the company Butterfly Effect, Manus isn't a conversation-based AI chatbot like ChatGPT or DeepSeek R1. Instead, it's an autonomous AI agent that, when given instructions from a user, doesn't just provide information, but independently carries out tasks.The creators of Manus call it ""the first general AI agent,"" and according to the Manus website, there are a lot of things it can do — such as screening resumes, planning a trip, or creating educational videos.For example, users can give Manus a set of resume files, and ask it to summarize the key points and rank all the candidates in a spreadsheet.Forbes praised Manus for its ability to carry out such a variety of tasks simultaneously — unlike other AI agents, which are designed to work only on one task at a time.But how good is it really?Some users have complained that it misses information that should be easy to find online.MIT Technology Review described Manus as ""promising but not perfect,"" saying that on some tasks Manus performs better than its rival, OpenAI's Deep Research. However, it added that Manus takes longer and often crashes.And TechCrunch found that Manus failed to carry out some simple tasks, saying that Manus probably isn't China's ""second DeepSeek moment"" after all.Most of us will have to wait and see how good Manus is, because it's still in invitation-only testing mode.Despite this, Manus has already released an advanced subscription service for $39 a month.And although a free version of Manus will be available, potential users may be interested to know that OpenAI has announced that its Deep Research AI agent will soon be available for free as well.","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on Manus?2.When do you think general AI agents will be commonplace?3.Would you trust an AI agent to do important tasks for you?4.Are many of your colleagues using AI in the workplace?5.How often do you use AI in your day-to-day life?

But in reality, they were found across North and South America up until around 10,000 years ago.  And now, scientists say they've brought the species back from extinction.US-based Colossal Biosciences says it has created new dire wolves by using ancient DNA, as well as cloning technology and editing the genes of a gray wolf — the dire wolf's closest living relative.The scientists used domestic dogs as surrogate mothers for three pups — two males and one female. There's debate as to whether they are true dire wolves, but they share key traits and genes with the ancient species.The main difference between modern wolves and dire wolves is their size. Dire wolves were around 25% bigger than gray wolves, and also had white fur.The two male pups are named Romulus and Remus. They're named after the mythical twins who were said to have founded the city of Rome. The story goes that they were looked after by a wolf as babies, after being left in a river by their mother.At 6 months old, Romulus and Remus weigh around 36 kilograms and are expected to weigh 68 kilograms when fully grown.The female pup has a name straight from Game of Thrones — Khaleesi. This is the title given to one of the series' main characters, Daenerys Targaryen, by the people she leads. The dire wolf Khaleesi is only 2 months old.All three pups are currently living at a secret location in the US, reports Time. Colossal Biosciences says the pups will never be able to live in the wild, but they have ample space and are carefully looked after.The company hopes to bring back a number of other extinct species, like the woolly mammoth, as well as help endangered species that are still alive today. For example, it has already used similar technology to produce four red wolves, the most endangered wolf species on the planet.","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on scientists bringing dire wolves back from extinction?2.Do you think animals that have been brought back from extinction should be released into the wild?3.Do you support the idea of using cloning to help endangered species?4.What extinct animal would you most like to see brought back to life?5.Do you have any concerns about cloning and genetic engineering?","Exercise 4Further Discussion Have a discussion based on the following questions.1.Do you know anyone who works as a scientist?

Kobe Shimbun reports that the Corleo is even expected to reach a top speed of 100 kilometers per hour.While a full version has yet to be completed, a mock-up of the Corleo can be seen at Expo 2025 Osaka, Kansai, Japan, which runs from April 13 to October 13.At the unveiling event in Osaka on April 3, Kawasaki's Takashi Torii, who has been in charge of the project, said he hopes to realize a full version of this type of vehicle by 2050.For now, however, all it seems the Corleo at Expo 2025 can do is stand up and crouch down a bit — so we may have to wait to see it jumping through the tall grass.","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on Kawasaki's Corleo?2.Would you be interested in riding a robot like the Corleo?3.Do you think this kind of robot will be commonplace in the future?4.What animal would you choose if you could design your own riding robot?5.What's the coolest piece of tech you've recently heard of or read about?","Exercise 4Further Discussion Have a discussion based on the following questions.1.Do you think you'd enjoy working in robotics?2.Are there any new gadgets or devices you'd like to get your hands on?3.If you had a personal robot, what jobs or tasks would you get it to do?4.Who are the biggest tech geeks you know?5.It's not that we use technology, we live technology. — Godfrey Reggio.

So it's no wonder they're the most popular pets in the world!However, dogs are also the world's most common large carnivore — and a pair of researchers from Curtin University in Perth, Australia, were concerned about the effect pet dogs are having on the environment.Reviewing a number of past studies, the researchers noted, for example, that flea and tick medication on dogs' fur can wash off into lakes and rivers when dogs swim. This medication can be toxic to local wildlife, and birds may even use pieces of this toxic fur to make their nests.Dogs can also pass on diseases to local wildlife, and pet dogs in Australia have been known to kill penguins and the chicks of endangered birds.Meanwhile, dogs running through birds' seaside nesting grounds might lead to exhaustion as those birds keep having to fly away — especially among migratory birds, who may have already used up much of their energy just to get to the beach.The researchers also noted that dog owners often ignore rules asking them to keep their dogs on leashes around birds' nesting areas — although a 2007 study found that just walking dogs through a woodland area, even on a leash, resulted in reduced bird abundance and diversity in the area.But the researchers also say the problem isn't really with dogs — it's with how many of them we have, and how little their owners tend to think about their effect on the environment.According to the World Population Review, there are between 700 million and 1 billion pet dogs in the world: 90 million dogs in the US, about 55 million each in Brazil and China, and another 20 million in Japan.The researchers say that, since we aren't about to stop having dogs as pets, we need to find more sustainable  ways to balance our love of our furry friends with our need to protect the world we share with them.","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on the study's findings? 2.Do you find it surprising that there are up to 1 billion pet dogs in the world? 3.Do you think most dog owners are aware of the impact their pets might have on the environment?4.Do you often see people ignoring leash rules where you live?5.What do you think could be done to help dog owners become more environmentally responsible?","Exercise 4Further Discussion Have a discussion based on the following questions.1.Do you own a dog?

It said that as a technology leader it has invested in Japan significantly to promote innovation.It's unclear if Google will take legal action to fight the order.The JFTC's order comes after similar moves in the US and Europe.In the US, a judge ruled last year that Google's search engine illegally exploited its influence to squash competition.

It became widely known when someone asked President Obama about it on an online forum in 2012. While Obama didn't answer, the question has sparked debates ever since — even among animal experts.Bird expert Kevin McGowan believes a horse-sized duck would be easy to fight. It wouldn't have a strong bite because ducks have flat bills.  And while normal ducks can fly, a giant duck wouldn't be able to do so, because it would need wings 100 times larger than usual just to lift its weight.Horse expert Wade Sundell thinks 100 duck-sized horses would be harder to fight. Horses can kick or step on you. And while one small horse wouldn't hurt much, a group of 100 could cause real problems.It's very unlikely that you'll ever find 100 duck-sized horses running toward you, of course — but Sundell has one piece of advice if you do: ""Try to get to safety as fast as you can,"" he said to Digital Trends.But John Eadie from the University of California would rather fight the horses.He argues that duck-sized horses would be small and easily scared, and their kicks wouldn't do much harm.On the other hand, a giant duck would be very tough to fight. Its wings could hit like a hammer — ducks have powerful chest muscles to move their wings, making them strong and hard to stop.Eadie also points out that ducks are omnivores, meaning they eat plants and animals, so a giant duck might see you as food. Horses, however, only eat plants, and wouldn't try to eat you.Of course, like so many of life's great questions, we'll never really know the answer.  But it's still fun to debate!","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What would you rather fight: one horse-sized duck or 100 duck-sized horses?2.Have you come across this question before?3.Have you heard of other similar questions that are fun to debate?4.Do you know anyone who's afraid of ducks or other birds?5.Have you ever been horse riding?

Each study looked at the use of digital technology, and included cognitive tests or diagnoses.Technology use in the studies included things like smartphones, computers, social media, internet and email. The participants' average age was 68 at the beginning of the studies.And the results showed that greater technology use among older adults was associated with a 42% lower risk of cognitive decline.There could be different reasons for this, the researchers said — for example, using technology could help keep the brain active. Another reason could be that technology helps older adults stay connected with other people — and many studies have shown that loneliness affects cognition later in life.However, some say more research is needed, because the studies didn't look at how each person was using technology or how long they used it for.The researchers also noted that people in this age group started using technology later in life, when their brains were already fully formed, so it's not clear if the same effect would be seen among people who have used this technology for most of their lives.Still, it's a good starting point for better understanding ways to stop or slow cognitive decline — especially in a world that has nearly 10 million new cases of dementia a year, according to the World Health Organization.","Exercise 3QuestionsAnswer the following questions about the article.1.How many different studies did the researchers look at? 2.What was the average age of the participants at the beginning of the studies?3.By how much did technology use lower the risk of cognitive decline in older adults?","Exercise 4DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on the findings of this study?2.Why do you think technology use may slow cognitive decline in older adults?3.Who are the most tech-savvy older adults you know?4.How much screen time do you get per day?5.Have you ever tried to limit your screen time?"

But the Earth's rotation isn't completely consistent, so since the 1960s, a type of atomic clock called a cesium clock has been used to define how long a second is.Cesium clocks direct radiation at cesium atoms, which are known to react to microwave radiation with a frequency of over 9 billion cycles per second — which is how long we now define a second to be.But now Japan's Shimadzu Corporation has created what it calls an ""optical lattice clock"" that uses strontium rather than cesium.Optical lattice clocks are estimated to be 100 to 1,000 times more accurate than cesium clocks, making them so precise that they aren't just useful for measuring time — they enable us to use our understanding of relativity to measure minute changes in altitude.According to Einstein's theory of relativity,  time moves more slowly the closer you are to a massive object — and since the Earth has a lot of mass, the further you are from its center, the faster time will move. So these clocks can detect tiny differences in time at different heights and distances.The Shimadzu team even demonstrated this with an earlier version of its clock in 2018, when it accurately measured the 450-meter height difference between the ground floor and the observatory floor at Tokyo Skytree.The hope is that a clock this precise will be able to measure altitude changes in the Earth's crust as small as 1 centimeter, which could give us early warnings of impending earthquakes.Shimadzu's clock doesn't look much like a clock — it's basically a 200-kilogram box a little over a meter wide and high.But you can buy one.The company started taking orders in March, at a suggested price of 500 million yen — $3.3 million — each.

We are really very behind in technology.""While common globally, such automation is a big achievement in Cuba due to the island's frequent power cuts and a lack of modern technology.Opened seven years ago, the restaurant gradually embraced technology, starting with tablets at tables, followed by Alexa services and culminating in the arrival of a food-delivering robot — also named Doña Alicia after the owner's grandmother — who now assists human waiters in the dining room.Guests are greeted with digital menus on screens at their tables, allowing them to order traditional Cuban dishes such as pork steak, pasta and sweet desserts. The bar further enhances the experience offering drinks such as mojitos or freshly made daiquiris. Human servers are on hand for those less used to technology.The prices are similar to those of other private restaurants — making them unaffordable for the average Cuban and reflecting the island's inflation.One challenge is that internet access in Cuba is limited and often unreliable — mobile internet only became widespread in 2018, and outages are frequent due to the energy crisis. But the restaurant appears to be managing these obstacles. Manager Yadiel Hernández believes the technological advancements help attract customers by creating a unique and appealing dining experience in Havana.""We've noticed a change,"" said Hernández. ""Both children and adults find it interesting to have a robotic assistant bring food to the table...it's a novel experience.""","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on Havana's Doña Alicia restaurant?2.Have you ever been served by a robot in a restaurant?

According to a new survey from the US, the average person begins to worry when their battery level falls to 38%.Most phones won't warn you about low battery levels until they get to 20%, but a lot of people start to panic long before that point.In fact, the survey found that almost a quarter of Americans start worrying before their phones get to 50%.But others said they don't panic until the level goes below 10%.Younger phone users are more likely to panic even when their battery life is pretty healthy. Having grown up with smartphones, they're probably more afraid of being disconnected and having to spend time without a working device.Of course, there are some things you can do to make your battery last longer, and most phones let you turn on battery saver mode to help that charge last a little longer.If you want to make small savings, Google says you can also try reducing screen brightness, turning off keyboard sounds or turning on dark mode.","Exercise 3QuestionsAnswer the following questions about the article.1.When does the average person begin to worry about their battery level?A.20% B.38% 2.What percentage of Americans start worrying before their battery gets to 50%?A.Almost a quarterB.Almost half3.Are younger or older people more likely to panic about their battery life?A.Younger peopleB.Older people","Exercise 4DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on the findings of this survey?2.At what point do you usually start worrying about your phone's battery life?3.Have you ever run out of battery on your phone at a really bad time?4.Do you ever carry a charger or power bank with you?5.How long do you think you'd be able to go without your phone?"

They used the lasers to target specific cells in the retina — the part of the eye that senses light.Normally, we see colors when light stimulates three types of cells in the retina, called L cones, M cones and S cones. These cells work together to create the full range of colors we know.However, in this experiment, the laser stimulated only the M cones, something natural light cannot do. This allowed scientists to see a color that can't be seen naturally.The scientists described olo as a blue-green color, but it's much more intense than anything we normally see. They shared an image of the color they thought olo was closest to, but said that just looking at a photo won't show you olo's true color — it has to be experienced through lasers.Not everyone agrees that it's a truly new color though, and some have dismissed it as a ""saturated green.""But that hasn't stopped one artist, Stuart Semple of the UK, from creating his own version of the color.  He named it ""yolo,"" which is slang for ""you only live once.""He's already selling his ""yolo"" paint for around $13,000 per 150-milliliter jar — though he'll sell it to you for about $40 if you say you're an artist.This isn't the first time Semple has challenged the art world.In 2016, another British artist, Anish Kapoor, bought the rights to the color ""Vantablack,"" which some call the world's blackest black, so only he could use it.Semple responded by creating a black paint of his own — and said Kapoor was not allowed to buy it.","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on the discovery of ""olo""?2.Do you have a favorite color?

And although each dive lasts only 30 seconds or less, they will continue to dive many times over a four- or five-hour period.Now scientists have found evidence that the haenyeo have evolved to be better adapted to this free diving lifestyle.The research team studied three groups of women: 30 haenyeo divers, 30 non-diving women from Jeju, and 31 people from mainland South Korea. All the participants were around 65 years old, which is the average age for haenyeo.The researchers studied the women's genomes from blood samples. They also measured the women's heart rates and blood pressure when they were resting and during simulated dives in which the women held their breath while submerging their faces in cold water.The researchers' first finding was that all residents of Jeju, whether haenyeo or not, are genetically distinct from people on the mainland, so both the divers and non-divers of Jeju share the same ancestors.During the simulated dives, it was found that the haenyeo had a much slower heart rate than other participants — which would help when diving by making a single breath last longer.But this ability was not shared by non-diving Jeju residents, so the researchers know it's the result of training and not a genetic adaptation.However, all the participants from Jeju, whether divers or not, were more likely than mainland South Koreans to have a gene associated with cold tolerance.They were also four times more likely to have a gene associated with lower blood pressure. A person's blood pressure increases when they dive, but for people with this gene it wouldn't increase as much.The researchers say this discovery could lead to the development of new treatments for high blood pressure.","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on Jeju's  haenyeo? 2.Do you find it surprising that haenyeo may have evolved to be better at diving than other people? 3.Have you tried free diving before?

Male silverback gorillas can be 10 times stronger than a human, and have a bite that's stronger than that of a lion.Meanwhile, the heaviest round stone a human has ever lifted high enough to drop over a waist-high bar weighed 286 kilograms.Still, some people on the internet say that humans used to hunt massive animals like mammoths, so they could beat a gorilla too.However, others say the gorilla is just too strong.Tara Stoinski from the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund, an organization that protects gorillas in the wild, agrees that gorillas are powerful.But she also believes that when it comes to 100 people, the numbers matter. If the humans work together, they can use strategies to tire the gorilla out.Still, Stoinski says, she's less surprised that humans could beat a gorilla and more surprised that people think a gorilla would even try to hurt humans.Gorillas aren't just strong — they're also calm, smart, social and, most of the time, peaceful and shy.If they feel threatened or need to defend their family, they can be aggressive.  ""But more often than not, they're very gentle animals,"" Stoinski told  Yahoo News.While the debate may just be for fun, Sacramento Zoo's Matt McKim hopes the conversation will shift.It's good that gorillas are getting attention online, he told Fox40.  But instead of asking whether 100 men could beat one gorilla, we should be talking about how to protect the animals, as some species of gorilla are endangered in the wild.","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.Do you think 100 people could defeat one silverback gorilla? 2.Did you know much about gorillas before reading the article? 3.Have you ever seen a gorilla in person?

It came from a desire that sites had to make themselves more popular without having to spend a lot of money on content.If people react to content, they're providing the site with free data about what's popular and what's not. The ability to react also keeps users on the site for longer and makes them more likely to return.But where did that Like button come from — was it a Facebook invention?No, says a new book called Like: The Button That Changed The World by Bob Goodson and Martin Reeves.Goodson was working at US reviews website Yelp and said that on May 18, 2005, he drew a sketch of a thumbs up and thumbs down gesture as a way for people to express their opinions about restaurant reviews posted on the site.Yelp didn't go with Goodson's suggestion and instead adopted ""useful,"" ""funny"" and ""cool"" buttons.The authors say that the Like button came about over time as some of the internet's most popular sites experimented with ways to get people to engage with their content.And according to the book, while Facebook is the main reason the Like button became so ubiquitous, the company almost didn't use it — CEO Mark Zuckerberg didn't like it.It took Facebook nearly two years to overcome Zuckerberg's resistance.Many people still have reservations about the button, claiming that reactions — or a lack of them — can cause emotional problems for vulnerable users.But with its worldwide popularity, it seems the Like button is here to stay.Bob Goodson's sketch from 2005.","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on the story behind the Like button?2.Would you like to read Like: The Button That Changed The World?3.Do you often like or comment on other people's posts on social media?4.Do you agree that the Like button has changed how people interact online?5.Do you know anyone who's concerned about the number of likes on their posts?","Exercise 4Further Discussion Have a discussion based on the following questions.1.How has the way you use social media changed over time?2.What social media platform is the most popular among your friends?3.Do you know anyone who doesn't use any form of social media? 4.In your opinion, what's the most useful thing about social media?5.How do you think social media platforms will change over the next decade?"

The decision to make AI mode broadly available after a relatively short test period reflects Google's confidence in the technology.Google is also feeding its latest AI model, Gemini 2.5, into its search algorithms and will soon begin testing other AI features, such as the ability to automatically buy concert tickets and conduct searches through live video feeds.The expansion builds upon a transformation that Google began a year ago with the introduction of conversational summaries called ""AI overviews"" that have been increasingly appearing at the top of its results page and eclipsing its traditional rankings of web links.About 1.5 billion people now regularly engage with ""AI overviews,"" according to Google, and most users are now entering longer and more complex queries.Google executives predicted AI overviews would lead to more searches and ultimately more clicks to other sites but it hasn't worked out that way so far, according to the findings of search optimization firm BrightEdge.Click-through rates from Google's search results have declined by nearly 30% during the past year, according to BrightEdge's recently released study, which said this may have happened because people are becoming increasingly satisfied with AI overviews.And Google's latest developments may lead to further legal challenges.

But new research has found that changing your location can be a really good way to boost your chances.Researchers from the US looked at data on Nobel laureates in chemistry, medicine and physics from 1901 to 2003.For each prizewinning scientist, the researchers had information about where they had been working, how long they had been working there, and when they began researching the subject that later won them the Nobel Prize.The study found that scientists who moved to a new location every two years began their prizewinning work about two years earlier than scientists who stayed in one place.Those who moved every five years began their Nobel-winning research a little more than six months earlier.One of the study's authors, Bruce Weinberg, said: ""For someone who might have taken 10 years to begin their prizewinning research if they stayed in one place, moving every two years could reduce that time by nearly a quarter.""He added: ""You're more likely to come up with that great new idea if you move around, meet new people, have new experiences, encounter new ways of thinking.""He said the same may be true for people working in creative jobs.Previous research has suggested that working in a big community of other researchers is really important, but Weinberg believes that people still need to move around to find new ideas and share their own.However, the research also found that becoming a Nobel laureate can still take a lot of time.

They also looked at the transport patterns of 12,500 other people in the country.Food and transport are two of the biggest contributors to pollution that heats up the planet. And the researchers said that in France, they account for more than half of all household carbon footprints.According to the United Nations (UN), ""Animal-based foods, especially red meat, dairy, and farmed shrimp, are generally associated with the highest greenhouse gas emissions.""The study, which has not yet been published in a journal, took into account the fact that men have to eat more calories than women, but still found there was a notable difference in consumption between men and women.The researchers suggested the reason may be that eating red meat and driving cars are ""often associated with male identity.""In some parts of the world, men who choose to eat vegan or vegetarian diets, or make vehicle choices based on what is better for the planet, are often dismissed as being less masculine.The research team also noted that single men were more likely to eat red meat because men living with partners and children share decision-making with other members of the household.One of the study's authors, Marion Leroutier, suggested that women tend to be more concerned about the climate crisis, and this may impact their decision making. However, she conceded that more research is needed to explore this idea.The UN says that in order to cut carbon emissions, people in wealthier countries should think about eating more plant-based meals, as well as reducing the amount of food they throw away.Moving away from gas-powered cars is also accepted as an important step.","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on the findings of this study?2.Do you find it surprising that men produce more carbon emissions than women?3.Would you say driving cars and eating meat are associated with male identity in your country?4.Have you made any lifestyle changes in order to reduce your carbon footprint?5.How concerned are you about the climate crisis?

These cups are often made of plastic, but even if they are made of paper, they sometimes have a plastic lining that makes it difficult for them to biodegrade.Making these cups, and disposing or burning them, also generates planet-warming emissions.When she was starting her business, Smithe emailed race directors to ask if their event used disposable cups.""The answer was always yes,"" she said.Now, she rents out thousands of cups, driving them to events in big bags and leaving bins with the company logo for collection after use.

Disposable cups might just cost a few cents each, while 10,000 Hiccup cups would rent for about 15 cents each.

And while many people are excited for these changes, there are concerns about what the new technology could mean for some jobs.And according to research from the United Nations' International Labour Organization (ILO), it's the jobs traditionally done by women that are most at risk.Working with Poland’s National Research Institute, the ILO has prepared a report entitled  Generative AI and Jobs: A Refined Global Index of Occupational Exposure.The report looked at nearly 2,900 work tasks, examining how likely they were to be automated with generative AI — that is, AI that can create things like text, audio and images. The report then grouped these tasks into specific jobs to estimate how ""exposed"" different types of work will be to AI.And it was found that a quarter of jobs around the world will potentially be ""exposed"" to generative AI. This increases to 34% of jobs in high-income countries.It was also found that 9.6% of traditionally female jobs in high-income countries are likely to be affected by AI, compared with 3.5% of those more traditionally done by men. This is because AI is increasingly being used to do the kind of administrative work done by people in clerical and secretarial jobs, who are more likely to be women.Other jobs more likely to be affected by AI are those in media, software and finance, as they too have a high proportion of tasks that can be automated and are highly digital.However, the ILO says there are few jobs that can be entirely automated. Even though many tasks can be made more efficient with generative AI, they generally still need a human involved.The report asks governments, companies and workers to collaborate to develop strategies to improve productivity and job quality, particularly in sectors that are more exposed to AI.The ILO's Janine Berg said the report ""helps countries across the world assess potential exposure and prepare their labor markets for a fairer digital future.""","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on the UN's findings? 2.Do you find it surprising that a quarter of jobs worldwide will potentially be ""exposed"" to AI? 3.What aspects of your job do you expect AI to impact?4.How concerned are you about the impact of AI on your industry?5.Would you say there's still a big difference in the types of jobs men and women do in your country?","Exercise 4Further Discussion Have a discussion based on the following questions.1.How often do you use AI tools in your work or daily life?2.What jobs do you think are safest from being replaced by AI?3.What new kinds of jobs do you think AI might create?4.What skills do you think will be most valuable in the labor market in the future? 5.What kinds of jobs do you think AI will never be able to do well?"

But why do we like it so much?One idea is that we quickly learn the patterns of music, and our brains feel rewarded when they can ""guess"" what will come next.But it may go deeper than that.Neural resonance theory, or NRT, proposes that, just as our body's internal clock synchronizes with the light and dark cycles of the Earth, our brains actually synchronize with the pitch and rhythm of music.This may be why we enjoy music so much — and why we can dance, keep time with a song, and even improvise music.Edward W. Large of the University of Connecticut says this isn't just an abstract idea. ""It's literally the sound causing a physical resonance in the brain,"" he told UConn Today.Along with other researchers from the US, the Netherlands, the UK and Canada, Large recently explained the principles of NRT in Nature Reviews Neuroscience.The researchers note, for example, that there's evidence of our brains continuing to react to musical harmonies even after the sounds have stopped.And scans have shown activity in the brain that correlates with keeping time with music, even if the music doesn't actually have a regular beat the listener can hear.According to NRT, this resonance is what makes us want to move and dance — and music connects not just to our ears and our brains, but even to our limbs and our spinal cords.""This theory suggests that music is powerful not just because we hear it, but because our brains and bodies become it,"" said Caroline Palmer of McGill University, one of the researchers who worked on the paper.""That has big implications for therapy, education and technology,"" Palmer said.The researchers say that NRT can give us insight into how the brain and body are connected, how music communicates emotion — and how our understanding of the effects of music could be applied to brain health.","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on neural resonance theory?2.Do you agree that music is a universal language?

Many heat-related deaths are unreported or are mislabeled by other conditions like heart disease or kidney failure.The scientists used peer-reviewed methods to study how much climate change boosted temperatures in an extreme heat event and calculated how much more likely its occurrence was because of climate change. In almost all countries, the number of extreme heat days has at least doubled compared with a world without climate change.Heat waves are silent killers, said Friederike Otto, associate professor of climate science at Imperial College London, one of the report's authors. ""People don't fall dead on the street in a heat wave ... people either die in hospitals or in poorly insulated homes and therefore are just not seen,"" he said.Low-income communities and vulnerable populations, such as older adults and people with medical conditions, suffer the most from extreme heat.The high temperatures recorded in the extreme heat events that occurred in Central Asia in March, South Sudan in February and in the Mediterranean last July would have not been possible without climate change, according to the report.City-led initiatives to tackle extreme heat are becoming popular in parts of South Asia, North America, Europe and Australia to coordinate resources across governments and other agencies. One example is a tree-planting initiative launched in Marseille, France, to create more shaded areas.The report says strategies to prepare for heat waves include monitoring and reporting systems for extreme temperatures, providing emergency health services, cooling shelters, updated building codes, enforcing heat safety rules at work, and designing cities to be more heat-resilient.But without phasing out fossil fuels, heat waves will continue becoming more severe and frequent and protective measures against the heat will lose their effectiveness, the scientists said.","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on the findings of this analysis?2.Have there been any extreme heat events in your country recently?3.How heat-resilient would you say your town or city is?

One tube had a swab with the scent of the cat's owner. Another held a swab with the scent of a stranger. The third was a clean swab with no smell.The cats spent more time sniffing the swabs with the stranger's scent than those with their owner's scent or the clean swab. This shows that the cats recognized that the smell was new, and not from someone they knew.Cats often use smell and scents to recognize and communicate with other cats. And in earlier studies, kittens also sniffed female cats they didn't know for longer than they sniffed their own mothers. So cats notice what's new, and take their time checking it out.After sniffing, some cats rubbed their faces on the tubes. This is a marking behavior, and means the cats may have been reacting to the smell or marking the tube with their own scent.The study shows that cats can tell the difference between smells from humans they know and smells from those they don't know.However, the researchers say it's still unclear if cats can recognize specific people just by smell, and more tests are needed to answer that question.For now, your cat might not know it's you by your smell alone — but they do know you're not a stranger!","Exercise 3QuestionsAnswer the following questions about the article.1.How many cats were in the study?2.Which of the tubes did the cats spend more time sniffing?3.Can cats recognize people just by their smell?","Exercise 4DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on the Tokyo University of Agriculture's findings?2.Does it surprise you that cats can recognize a stranger by their smell?3.Do you like cats?

But unlike night vision goggles, the new contact lenses don't need a power source, and when people wear them they can see all the normally visible colors of the spectrum at the same time as infrared light.To create the lenses, the scientists used upconversion nanoparticles — tiny materials that can convert infrared light into visible light.In a previous study, the scientists had given mice infrared vision by injecting these nanoparticles into their eyes.For their latest study, which has been published in the journal Cell, they added these nanoparticles to contact lenses. They then tested the contact lenses on both mice and humans.To test the lenses on mice, they gave the animals a choice between a dark box or a box lit with infrared light. Mice wearing lenses chose a dark box, but mice that weren't wearing lenses had no preference for either box.People wearing the lenses were able to see infrared light flashing from an LED and they could tell which direction the light was coming from, while people who weren't wearing the contact lenses couldn't see the light at all.The lenses even worked better when participants had their eyes closed. Because infrared light easily passes through eyelids and visible light doesn't pass through so easily, the infrared light actually became clearer when participants closed their eyes.The scientists say this technology could be used in the future to help colorblind people by converting colors they cannot see into colors that they can.For now, vision through the lenses is not clear, and the lenses cannot pick up low levels of infrared. However, the scientists believe the lenses can be improved, and in the future could give people ""super-vision.""","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on this invention?2.Would you be interested in trying contact lenses that let you see infrared light?3.Do you wear glasses?

Until then, everything seemed to be going well.CEO and founder of ispace Takeshi Hakamada apologized to everyone who helped with the mission.It's the second time one of the company's landers has crashed while trying to land on the moon.The first attempt ended in disappointment two years ago. The company said it was too soon to know whether the same problem caused both missions to fail.The latest spacecraft, known as ""Resilience,"" was carrying a rover with a shovel to gather lunar dirt as well as a Swedish artist's toy-size red house.""This is the second time that we were not able to land.  So we really have to take it very seriously,"" Hakamada told reporters. He said that the company would not stop trying to reach the moon.Sending vehicles into space was once something that only national governments did. But in recent years, private companies have been competing to get their vehicles to the moon — with more failures than successes.But in March this year a spacecraft made by US firm Firefly Aerospace reached the moon — this was the first time a private company had successfully sent a lander there.Another spacecraft made by a US company — Intuitive Machines — arrived at the moon a few days later.Besides competition, the goal for these landers is to gather data and collect moon samples.Only five countries have made successful robotic lunar landings: Russia, the US, China, India and Japan.","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on ispace's failed lunar landing?2.Do you find it surprising that only five countries have successfully landed robots on the moon?3.Have you ever followed any space missions or landings?4.Do you think your country should invest more in space exploration?5.Would you invest in a private space company if you were a billionaire?","Exercise 4Further Discussion Have a discussion based on the following questions.1.If you had the chance to go to the moon, would you take it?2.Do you think space tourism will become common within your lifetime?3.Do you believe that intelligent life exists beyond Earth?4.What do you find most fascinating about the universe?5.Curiosity is the essence of our existence. — Gene Cernan.

It causes shaking, stiff muscles, slow movement and trouble walking.There is no cure, but finding the disease early helps people get the care they need faster.Right now, most doctors look for signs like shaking or slow movement, but these methods aren't always accurate. Other tests, like checking spinal fluid, require expensive tools and expert doctors.Now, a team from the University of California, Los Angeles, says it has developed a new 3D-printed pen that can help, with a small study showing some promising results.""It is very cost-effective and fully accessible for lower income countries,"" Jun Chen, one of the researchers who worked on the study, told The Guardian.The pen has a soft silicone tip with magnetic parts inside. The pen is filled with special ink that reacts to the magnet in the tip. When someone writes or draws, the pen creates signals based on the hand's movement. These signals are then read by a phone app.In total, 16 people took part in the study, with three of them having Parkinson's. The researchers asked the participants to draw spirals or wavy lines, or to write letters on surfaces or in the air.The researchers then used machine learning, a type of artificial intelligence, to study the signals. After training the system, one model was able to tell who had Parkinson's with 96% accuracy.Experts say the idea is intriguing, but more testing is needed, as Parkinson's affects more than just handwriting. Still, this pen might help doctors notice the disease earlier.Becky Jones from Parkinson's UK said the study was small but promising.""While this study is very small, involving just three people with Parkinson's, it offers a new way of thinking about diagnosis by looking at changes in handwriting, which can be an early symptom,"" she told The Guardian.","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on this invention?2.Were you aware that Parkinson's disease affects over 10 million people globally?3.Would you trust a diagnosis made by an AI tool?4.What impact do you imagine AI will have on the future of healthcare?5.Do you think AI will ever be able to replace doctors?","Exercise 4Further Discussion Have a discussion based on the following questions.1.What do you think are the most important medical innovations of recent times?2.What are the biggest challenges your country's healthcare system is facing?3.Would you say that everyone in your country has access to quality healthcare?4.What countries do you imagine have the best healthcare systems?5.The future of AI is not about replacing humans, it's about augmenting human capabilities. — Sundar Pichai.

During this time the program has built up a huge library of recordings of the sounds these dolphins make.Previous studies have shown that dolphins have ""signature whistles"" that they use to identify themselves. This study looked at non-signature whistles, which make up about 50% of the whistles made by Sarasota Bay dolphins.Sayigh told National Geographic that these non-signature whistles ""could function like words of some kind, with specific meanings.""The researchers have identified 22 different non-signature whistles that are used by many dolphins, two of which are used by at least 25 different dolphins.To study the whistles' purpose, the researchers played recordings of these two sounds back to the dolphins.One of the recordings mostly caused the dolphins to move away, which suggests it functions as an alarm.The other recording seemed to cause a variety of responses in the dolphins, which was similar to how they responded to unfamiliar whistles. The researchers suggest this sound is used like a question when dolphins hear something unexpected.In another experiment, two dolphins were played recordings of their own signature whistles — and responded with the question whistle. This suggests they did not understand why they were hearing their own signature sounds and were responding with surprise.The researchers say their findings are the first evidence in dolphins of ""shared, context-specific signals, which could form the basis for a language-like communication system.""","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on this discovery?2.Do you find it surprising that dolphins may use sounds like words?3.Have you ever seen a dolphin in person?

Most of the families were from the US or New Zealand.The families were split into two groups. One group was given a four-week course on using music at home with their babies. Parents in this group were sent materials such as karaoke-style videos of children's songs, musical books, and tips on how to make singing a part of daily life.They weren't told exactly how or when to sing — the idea was to make music a normal part of caregiving.The second group received the same materials after the study had finished.To track results, researchers sent short surveys to parents during the day. These asked about the baby's mood, if the baby had been fussy, how they were soothed, and how the parent was feeling.Parents in the first group said they used singing more often to calm their babies, even though they weren't specifically told to do that.Most importantly, babies in the singing group had better moods overall, and this effect lasted even after the course ended. Parents' own moods didn't change, which suggests the happier babies were not just an offshoot of parents feeling better themselves.A larger, longer study is now in progress looking at the effects of things like listening to music and reading books as well as singing.

That research may have gotten a boost recently when scientists extended the lives of mice by around 30% with a mix of two drugs.The two drugs used in the study were called rapamycin and trametinib, both of which are used in cancer treatment. Rapamycin is also an immunosuppressant drug used in organ transplants to prevent rejection.A team led by scientists from the Max Planck Institute in Germany gave the drugs to mice, with some receiving just one of the two drugs, while other mice were given both. The researchers then compared the health and lifespans of these mice with a control group given no drugs.Rapamycin has already been seen to extend the lifespan of a number of animals, including mice. And the mice in this study that were given just this drug lived for 17% to 18% longer than mice in the control group. Mice given just the other drug also lived for 7% to 16% longer.However, the mice given both drugs saw the greatest effect, with their lifespans extended by anywhere from 26% to 35%.The mice given both drugs didn't just live longer — they were also healthier for longer. They were more active in later life compared to the control group, and had lower body weights. Their heart health declined more slowly too.The researchers also found that mice given the two-drug cocktail reduced their risk of liver tumors, while male mice had a reduced risk of spleen tumors.However, while these results are exciting, the possible effects on humans aren't expected to be nearly as dramatic. It's more likely that a similar drug cocktail might improve human health in old age, without necessarily extending how long we live.As study co-author Linda Partridge explained, ""While we do not expect a similar extension to human lifespans as we found in mice, we hope that the drugs we're investigating could help people to stay healthy and disease-free for longer late in life.""","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on the findings of this study?2.Do you think life-extending drugs will be commonplace in the future?3.Do you think the average human lifespan will increase by much over the next few decades?4.In your opinion, what would be the ideal human lifespan?5.If you could stay one age forever, what age would you choose?","Exercise 4Further Discussion Have a discussion based on the following questions.1.Who are the healthiest older people you know?2.What do you think is the key to living a long and healthy life?3.What's something you look forward to about getting older?4.What medical breakthroughs do you hope you live to see?5.What excites you most about the future of medicine and healthcare?"

Fossil fuel corporations, along with other companies, have promoted tree-planting as a key part of carbon offset programs in recent years.To do their calculations, the researchers looked at the 200 largest holders of fossil fuel reserves — the fuel that companies promise shareholders they can extract in the future — and calculated how much carbon dioxide would be released if this fuel is burned.Leading environmental scientist Jonathan Foley, who was not involved in the study, explained the results another way.""Trees are the sponges and the mops we use to clean up the mess,"" he said.

It actually may have to do with telegraphs!Early typewriters of the 19th century often resembled pianos, with letters on the large and small keys in alphabetical order. Inventor Christopher Latham Sholes, known as the ""father of the typewriter,"" used a piano-style design for his own first typewriter, which he sold to a telegraph college in Chicago in 1868.But Sholes continued to modify his design. As he added the numbers and punctuation marks telegraph operators told him they needed to transcribe their messages, he soon developed a keyboard with four rows of characters — a shape very similar to the one we know today.It was long believed that Sholes' new key arrangement intentionally spread out the most commonly used letters to keep his typewriters from jamming when adjacent keys were hit too quickly. But his arrangement actually developed quite gradually, and may have been influenced more by the quirks of American Morse Code.For example, Z was sent as ""dot-dot-dot, pause, dot.""  But S was ""dot-dot-dot,"" and E was ""dot,"" so it was sometimes difficult for telegraph operators to know if they were receiving a Z or an SE. This may be why Z, S and E came to be placed close together on the left side of the keyboard.By the time Sholes sold his design to the gun company E. Remington and Sons in 1873, it nearly had QWERTY at the top left, but there was a period in place of the R.The company and Sholes modified this design yet again, and when the ""Sholes & Glidden Type-Writer"" was first sold in April 1874, it had QWERTY at the top left.In 1882, Remington started selling typewriters through yet another company, and it moved a few letters — including M, N, X and C — to avoid patent issues. By 1898, this arrangement was adopted by all five of America's leading typewriter companies, and those 26 letters have stayed in the same positions ever since.","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on the story behind the QWERTY keyboard?2.Do you do a lot of typing for your job?

So would you put a battery-powered ""e-tattoo"" on your head if it could help you better manage your workload?Researchers at the University of Texas at Austin have developed an e-tattoo, or electronic tattoo, that goes on your forehead and can track how hard your brain is working. It does this by using sensors to monitor brain activity and eye movement, using this information to estimate your level of mental strain as you work.While we've had technology for tracking mental strain for some time, it tends to be too big and uncomfortable to wear for an extended period of time — and also needs to be plugged in, making it impractical for anyone who needs to move around for their work. This is why the researchers looked at using an e-tattoo.E-tattoos aren't actually something you have to permanently put on your skin. They're soft, light, wearable devices that can be put anywhere on the body and look a bit like real tattoos. They can be used to track anything from physical activity to the chemicals in your sweat — and even your brain waves.The Texas researchers tested their e-tattoo by having six people wear one while doing increasingly difficult tasks on a computer. As the tasks got more challenging, the device picked up brain waves and activity associated with greater mental workload.The device could be very useful for people in high-stress jobs where overwork could lead to deadly mistakes, such as pilots and health care workers.The university's Nanshu Lu said that when it's complete, he expects the full device will cost less than $200.The research team is now developing a way for the e-tattoo to send alerts to wearers through an app, letting them know when they should take a break or reduce some of their workload.","Exercise 3DiscussionHave a discussion based on the following questions.1.What are your thoughts on the ""e-tattoo""? 2.Under what circumstances would you consider using a device like this? 3.What would you say are the most stressful aspects of your job?4.Do you often take breaks while working?

Nanoplastics are even smaller — they're less than 0.000001 millimeters across.The researchers suggested that simply unwrapping plastic-covered food or tearing open a plastic food package can cause these tiny particles to be released.The same is true of brewing a tea bag in hot water or opening drinks cartons and bottles that have plastic tops.In fact, the research team said that microplastics and nanoplastics are released every time a carton or bottle is reopened.The research team said its study provided the ""first systematic evidence"" of how normal use of plastic-packed foods and drinks can contaminate foodstuffs with microplastics.To get their findings, researchers looked at 103 different studies on microplastics. While these varied in quality and reliability, the researchers said seven were found to be ""highly reliable.""And the researchers concluded that microplastics and nanoplastics enter food and drinks from a large variety of sources — although further high-quality research is needed.It's still not clear exactly how harmful microplastics and nanoplastics are to our bodies. But studies on animal and human cells have suggested that they could be linked to an increased risk of cancer and heart problems, as well as other issues.Experts from Stanford University in the US have said that microplastics are ""impossible"" to avoid because they are ""in the water we drink, the food we eat, the clothes we wear, and the air we breathe.""But they say we can reduce our exposure to them.
